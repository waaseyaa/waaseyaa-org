# CLI Console

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-25 - #2122 maintenance-mode commands: `MaintenanceServiceProvider` (ProvidesConsoleCommandsInterface) registers `maintenance:on` (`--retry-after`, `--message`), `maintenance:off`, and `maintenance:status` (`--json`) as conventional `HandlerCommand`s dispatching to `Maintenance{On,Off,Status}Handler`. The commands are idempotent with script-friendly exit codes (on/off → 0 on desired state reached, non-zero only on I/O failure; status → 0 serving, 1 in maintenance incl. fail-closed) so deploy tooling can bracket a DB swap. No CLI-kernel mechanics, parsing, IO, or registration contract changed — these use the existing HandlerCommand/provider-discovery seams unchanged. Operator surface: docs/specs/operations-playbooks.md "Playbook I" + CLI Command Reference. Acceptance: MaintenanceCommandsTest. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-17 - #2064 WP2 adds optional reason-specific field-read declarations to HandlerCommand metadata. CliFieldReadCapabilityIssuer preserves the exact CLI-valid closed reason, opens an explicit live execution-boundary proof, and binds NoActingContext with a null actor; no CLI account principal or ambient privileged scope is created. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-17 - #2064 WP3 registers exact `field-access:preflight --format=json` names-only inventory output; it is read-only unless `--write-artifact` is supplied, and the artifact write is atomic. Normal entity accessor activation remains dormant. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-02 - #2171 `field-access:preflight` inventory keys are CANONICAL column names. `DatabaseFieldAccessInventoryScanner` reads names via `Waaseyaa\Database\Schema\TableColumnNames` rather than `array_keys(listTableColumns())`: Doctrine keys that map by the QUOTED identifier for reserved words, so a column named `key` previously entered the inventory as `<type>|*|"key"` — a live key no field definition could ever classify, leaving `unclassified_entries` non-empty and `ready` false forever for any consumer with a reserved-word column. The same literal also poisoned the schema fingerprint. Inventory key format is unchanged (`entityType|bundle|field`); what changed is that `field` is now the canonical name. Scanner generation is unchanged at 2. Acceptance: ReservedWordColumnPreflightTest. -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-14 - R24 CLI minors (#2020): Composer provenance rejects lockfile dist paths outside the project root; production migration diagnostics redact absolute Unix/Windows files and bare directories; ai:run clears prior SIGINT state and describes the default synchronous Messenger bus honestly; entity:list documents its intentional operator-level access-check opt-out. CLI actor context remains null by design because the console has no authenticated principal; introducing a fabricated system identity is explicitly not part of this sweep. -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-14 - R21 WP6 (#2010): queue:retry now shares FailedJobRepositoryInterface's atomic retry claim with the HTTP API. A claim loser exits 1 without dispatching; dispatch exceptions release the claim; successful dispatch forgets the row. Command parsing, IO, and registration contracts are unchanged. -->

## Purpose

`packages/cli/` provides the Symfony Console based command-line interface for Waaseyaa applications. The CLI entry point boots the Waaseyaa Foundation console kernel, constructs a `Symfony\Component\Console\Application`, registers framework and app commands from service providers, and delegates command parsing, help rendering, input/output handling, and execution to Symfony Console.

The CLI package sits at **Layer 6 - Interfaces**. Lower layers expose services, schedules, migrations, and domain operations that CLI commands consume; lower layers must not depend on `waaseyaa/cli`.

## Public Surface

| Surface | Role |
|---|---|
| `packages/cli/bin/waaseyaa` | Composer bin entrypoint. Must be invoked from a project root containing `composer.json`. |
| `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Kernel\ConsoleKernel` | Console composition root. Boots the framework and runs the Symfony Console application. |
| `Waaseyaa\CLI\ConsoleApplicationFactory` | Creates and configures the Symfony Console application. |
| `Waaseyaa\CLI\WaaseyaaConsoleApplication` | Waaseyaa-specific Symfony application subclass for compatibility policies such as exit codes and terse errors. |
| `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability\ProvidesConsoleCommandsInterface` | Provider capability for registering Symfony command services, FQCNs, or command instances. |

Command classes extend `Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command` and declare their input contract with `InputArgument` and `InputOption`.

## Command Discovery

Commands are discovered during Foundation console boot from service providers declared in `extra.waaseyaa.providers`.

Supported discovery forms:

1. Providers implement `ProvidesConsoleCommandsInterface` and return Symfony command service IDs, command FQCNs, or command instances.
2. Command services may be exposed through the Waaseyaa DI container and loaded through a Symfony command loader.
3. A future attribute-based path may allow command classes annotated with `#[AsConsoleCommand]` to be cached by `PackageManifestCompiler`.

The package manifest may cache console command providers or command service metadata, but command execution is always performed by Symfony Console.

## Command Registration

`ConsoleKernel::bootForCli()` boots the provider registry and DI container. The console application factory then:

1. Creates `Application('Waaseyaa CLI', $version)`.
2. Configures exception handling and auto-exit for process or test context.
3. Adds command services from providers or the command loader.
4. Validates duplicate command names.
5. Enforces framework-owned command namespace policies, including the reserved `config:*` verbs.

Providers should register command services in `register()` and expose them through the console command provider capability. Commands that need project-root state receive it through constructor injection from a kernel-context service.

## Input And Output

Commands use Symfony Console input/output:

- `InputInterface` for arguments and options.
- `OutputInterface` or `ConsoleOutputInterface` for stdout and stderr.
- `SymfonyStyle` for interactive questions and structured operator output where appropriate.
- `QuestionHelper` and `InputInterface::isInteractive()` for prompt behavior.

Command implementations must preserve established stdout/stderr behavior for script-facing commands, especially JSON output modes and concise error messages.

## Error Handling

The Symfony Console application owns top-level exception rendering. Waaseyaa-specific behavior:

- Input and usage errors return exit code `2`.
- Command/domain failures return exit code `1`.
- Unknown commands include a hint to run `waaseyaa list`.
- Stack traces are shown only at verbose/debug verbosity.
- Uncaught command exceptions are logged through `LoggerInterface` when available.

Command-level validation should print concise stderr messages and return `Command::FAILURE`.

## Help And Usage Rendering

Symfony Console owns:

- `waaseyaa list`
- `waaseyaa help`
- `waaseyaa help <command>`
- `waaseyaa <command> --help`
- global options
- argument and option formatting

Waaseyaa preserves these operator-facing requirements:

- A bare `waaseyaa` invocation prints a short usage hint and exits `0`.
- `waaseyaa list` lists all registered commands.
- `waaseyaa help` with no command lists available commands during the backward-compatibility window.
- Existing command names, descriptions, argument descriptions, and option descriptions are migrated into Symfony command configuration.

Snapshot tests should assert semantic command/help content unless exact byte formatting is declared a compatibility contract for a specific command.

## Versioning

The Symfony application version is resolved from the project `VERSION` file, package provenance, or a dedicated `VersionResolver` service. `waaseyaa --version` is handled by Symfony Console.

`waaseyaa:version` remains a richer diagnostic command and continues to support its JSON and strict/report-only modes.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Command/domain failure or uncaught handler exception. |
| `2` | Usage/input error: unknown command, invalid option, missing required argument, or invalid argument shape. |
| `64`-`78` | Reserved for future sysexits-style categories. |
| `130` | Interrupted by SIGINT where command/application signal handling reports it. |

## Signal Handling

Commands that need signal handling use Symfony Console signal facilities where available or command-local `pcntl_signal()` handling when the extension exists.

Required behaviors:

- `queue:work` delegates to `Waaseyaa\Queue\Worker`, which handles `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`.
- `ai:run --watch` preserves clean interruption of the SSE watcher while leaving the agent run active server-side.
- Generic console boot must not install broad signal handlers that hide command-specific shutdown semantics.

## Testing

Use Symfony Console testing tools:

- `Symfony\Component\Console\Tester\CommandTester` for individual commands.
- `Symfony\Component\Console\Tester\ApplicationTester` for application-level behavior.

Required coverage:

- command registration from providers
- no-arg invocation
- `list`, `help`, `<command> --help`
- unknown command and input-error exit code `2`
- version output
- stdout/stderr split
- JSON output modes
- non-interactive prompt defaults
- signal-aware commands
