Specification for how Waaseyaa packages are discovered, registered, booted, and compiled into optimized artifacts.

## Overview

Waaseyaa uses a two-phase discovery system:

1. **Coarse-grained**: Composer `extra.waaseyaa` in each package's `composer.json` declares providers, commands, routes, migrations, and permissions.
2. **Fine-grained**: PHP 8 attributes on classes (`#[FieldType]`, `#[Listener]`, `#[AsMiddleware]`, `PolicyAttribute`) are scanned at compile time from the union of Composer's autoload classmap and all eligible PSR-4 directories. `FieldType` is the Layer-1 plugin attribute (`Waaseyaa\Field\Attribute\FieldType`); the old Foundation `AsFieldType` marker is deprecated and ignored. PSR-4 is never conditional on the classmap being empty: an ordinary non-optimized install has a valid partial classmap.

Both are unified by `PackageManifestCompiler` into a single cached artifact at `storage/framework/packages.php`.

The cache fingerprint includes `composer.json`, `installed.json`, `autoload_classmap.php`, `autoload_psr4.php`, and — #2778 — the current on-disk `composer.json` of every installed **path** package (an installed package whose `installed.json` entry marks `dist.type === 'path'` or `source.type === 'path'`; `install-path` presence alone is not the signal, since Composer 2.x stamps it on every installed package regardless of origin). Changing autoload optimization therefore invalidates and recompiles the artifact, and so does a path package editing its own `extra.waaseyaa` declarations even when root/`installed.json`/autoload stay byte-identical; a cached policy set is also checked against the independent `extra.waaseyaa.policies` inventory before it can boot. See "ManifestBootstrapper" in `docs/specs/infrastructure.md` for the fingerprint's full authority and invalidation rule.

## ServiceProvider Lifecycle

### Interface

File: `packages/foundation/src/ServiceProvider/ServiceProviderInterface.php`

```php
namespace Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider;

interface ServiceProviderInterface
{
    public function register(): void;
    public function boot(): void;
    public function provides(): array;
    public function isDeferred(): bool;
}
```

### Abstract base class

File: `packages/foundation/src/ServiceProvider/ServiceProvider.php`

```php
abstract class ServiceProvider implements ServiceProviderInterface
{
    abstract public function register(): void;
    public function boot(): void {}

    public function provides(): array { return []; }
    public function isDeferred(): bool { return $this->provides() !== []; }

    // Binding helpers
    protected function singleton(string $abstract, string|callable $concrete): void;
    protected function bind(string $abstract, string|callable $concrete): void;
    protected function tag(string $abstract, string $tag): void;

    // Introspection (binding/tag reflection)
    public function getBindings(): array;   // ['abstract' => ['concrete' => ..., 'shared' => bool]]
    public function getTags(): array;       // ['tag' => ['service1', 'service2']]
}
```

### Two-phase lifecycle

**Phase 1 -- register()**: Pure binding. No side effects. No resolving other services. All packages call `register()` before any `boot()` runs.

```php
public function register(): void
{
    $this->singleton(EntityStorageInterface::class, SqlEntityStorage::class);
    $this->singleton(EntityTypeManagerInterface::class, EntityTypeManager::class);
    $this->tag(SqlEntityStorage::class, 'storage');
}
```

**Phase 2 -- boot()**: All bindings are available from all packages. Safe to resolve cross-package dependencies, register event listeners, configure services.

```php
public function boot(): void
{
    // All packages are registered; cross-package resolution is safe here
}
```

### Deferred providers

A provider is deferred if `provides()` returns a non-empty array. Deferred providers are only loaded when one of their declared interfaces is first resolved. This keeps cold boot fast.

```php
public function provides(): array
{
    return [AiEmbedderInterface::class, AiCompletionInterface::class];
}
```

## Composer Manifest

### Default composition and opt-in domains

Composer installation is the activation boundary for domain packages. The root
`waaseyaa/framework` package and the curated `core`, `cms`, and `full`
metapackages must not select genealogy, AI-agent execution, OIDC issuer, MCP
endpoint, Wayfinding, messaging, or social engagement. Applications install
those packages explicitly by name. `suggest` entries may advertise a compatible
integration, but must not change the solved package graph.

Provider, entity-type, route, command, and attribute discovery operates only on
packages present in Composer's `installed.json`. Source availability in the
monorepo and a path-repository declaration are not activation. The monorepo may
retain opt-in domains in its root `require-dev` so their package suites run;
Composer does not propagate a dependency package's development requirements to
consumers, so this does not activate them in a scratch framework install.

This boundary is installation-level only. Per-site API exposure overrides are a
separate concern and cannot make an uninstalled package discoverable.

Fine-grained agent tools may declare `requiresPackage` on `#[AsAgentTool]` when
the tool is an integration with another opt-in domain. The compiler includes
that tool only when the named Composer package is present in `installed.json`;
ordinary tools omit the argument and retain unconditional discovery.

### Package composer.json format

`extra.waaseyaa` is the **only authoritative registration path** for providers, commands, and routes. Hidden registration channels (kernel-internal hard-coded lists, side imports, manual `Application::add()` calls outside of `HasCommandsInterface`) are forbidden — every active framework package surfaces its providers and commands through this manifest entry, and `PackageManifestCompiler` is the single source the kernel reads. Active framework packages with this declaration include `waaseyaa/foundation`, `waaseyaa/api`, `waaseyaa/graphql`, `waaseyaa/mcp`, `waaseyaa/cli`, `waaseyaa/telescope`, `waaseyaa/admin-surface`, `waaseyaa/routing`, and the various entity-package providers.

Each package declares its registration metadata in `extra.waaseyaa`:

```json
{
    "name": "waaseyaa/node",
    "extra": {
        "waaseyaa": {
            "providers": ["Waaseyaa\\Node\\NodeServiceProvider"],
            "policies": ["Waaseyaa\\Node\\NodeAccessPolicy"],
            "commands": ["Waaseyaa\\Node\\Command\\NodeCreateCommand"],
            "routes": ["Waaseyaa\\Node\\NodeRouteProvider"],
            "migrations": "migrations/",
            "config": "config/",
            "permissions": {
                "create node content": {
                    "title": "Create node content",
                    "description": "Allows creating new nodes"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Supported keys:
| Key | Type | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| `providers` | `string[]` | ServiceProvider FQCNs |
| `policies` | `string[]` | Complete package-owned `#[PolicyAttribute]` class inventory; missing entries/classes fail boot |
| `commands` | `string[]` | CLI command FQCNs |
| `routes` | `string[]` | Route provider FQCNs |
| `migrations` | `string` | Path to migrations directory (relative to package) |
| `config` | `string` | Path to default config directory |
| `permissions` | `object` | Permission definitions with title and optional description |

### Root composer.json conventions

The monorepo root uses `self.version` constraints for all `waaseyaa/*` packages and path repository references. The root manifest is published to Packagist as `waaseyaa/framework`; `self.version` resolves to `dev-main` against local path repos and to the exact tag version when consumers install from Packagist (see #1382). It also carries its own `extra.waaseyaa` block — the framework root reserves `extra.waaseyaa.providers` as an extension point for repo-level service providers, alongside the `admin_path` configuration:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        { "type": "path", "url": "packages/*" }
    ],
    "require": {
        "waaseyaa/foundation": "self.version",
        "waaseyaa/entity": "self.version"
    },
    "extra": {
        "waaseyaa": {
            "admin_path": "packages/admin",
            "providers": []
        }
    }
}
```

Consumer applications populate `extra.waaseyaa.providers` with their own application-level service providers; the framework monorepo root keeps it empty because all framework providers live in their owning packages.

### ProviderDiscovery

File: `packages/foundation/src/ServiceProvider/ProviderDiscovery.php`

Reads `vendor/composer/installed.json` and collects all `extra.waaseyaa.providers` entries:

```php
final class ProviderDiscovery
{
    public function discoverFromArray(array $installed): array;
    public function discoverFromVendor(string $vendorPath): array;
}
```

Returns `list<class-string<ServiceProviderInterface>>`.

**Runtime orchestration**: At boot time, `AbstractKernel` delegates provider instantiation and registration to `ProviderRegistry` (`packages/foundation/src/Kernel/Bootstrap/ProviderRegistry.php`), which reads provider class names from the compiled `PackageManifest` and calls `register()` on each. See the Kernel Bootstrap section of the infrastructure spec for details.

### Provider capability interfaces

Beyond `register()` / `boot()`, a provider opts into kernel-invoked hooks by implementing a named capability interface under `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability`. The call site checks `instanceof` and queries the implementors once at kernel boot. Current capabilities include:

| Interface | Method | Collected at boot into |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| `HasNativeCommandsInterface` | `nativeCommands(): iterable` (yields `CommandDefinition`) | `CliKernel` command table |
| `HasMiddlewareInterface` | `middleware(EntityTypeManager): list` | HTTP middleware pipeline |
| `HasHttpDomainRoutersInterface` | `httpDomainRouters(HttpKernel): iterable` | Domain router chain |
| `HasRenderCacheListenersInterface` | `registerRenderCacheListeners(...)` | Render cache listeners |
| `AcceptsMigrationProvidersInterface` | `withMigrationProviders(list)` | Migration registry |
| `AcceptsAgentToolProvidersInterface` | `withAgentToolProviders(list)` | Agent-tool registry provider |
| `AcceptsAiCatalogEntryProvidersInterface` | `withAiCatalogEntryProviders(list)` | experimental AI-catalog registry provider |
| `ProvidesAiCatalogEntriesInterface` | `aiCatalogEntries(): iterable` | intentionally public AI artifacts |
| `AcceptsApiCatalogEntryProvidersInterface` | `withApiCatalogEntryProviders(list)` | API-catalog registry provider |
| `ProvidesApiCatalogEntriesInterface` | `apiCatalogEntries(): iterable` | RFC 9727 public API catalog |
| `ProvidesRolesInterface` | `roles(): iterable` (yields `Waaseyaa\User\Role`) | `RoleRepository` |
| `ProvidesPermissionsInterface` | `permissions(): array` (`id => {title, description}`) | kernel-owned `PermissionHandler` catalogue, bound as `PermissionHandlerInterface` (#2788) |
| `ProvidesApplicationMasterRekeyContributionsInterface` | `applicationMasterRekeyContributions(): iterable` (yields `ApplicationMasterRekeyContribution`) | `ApplicationMasterRekeyComposition` frozen active-owner graph |

`ProvidesRolesInterface::roles()` returns an untyped `iterable` rather than a typed return, exactly as `HasNativeCommandsInterface::nativeCommands()` yields Layer-6 `CommandDefinition`s without importing them. Keeping the return untyped lets the Foundation (Layer 0) interface yield `Waaseyaa\User\Role` (Layer 1) without Foundation importing the User package; the concrete element type is resolved by the Layer-1 collector (`RoleRepository::fromProviders()`) at runtime. `ProvidesPermissionsInterface::permissions()` returns a plain array for the same reason: Foundation cannot import the Access package, so the Layer-1 collector (`PermissionHandler::fromProviders()`) validates the shape. It composes one catalogue from these contributions plus every package's and the root application's `extra.waaseyaa.permissions` (the manifest key documented above), and the kernel refuses to boot when a `ProvidesRolesInterface` role grants a permission that catalogue does not declare — a provider that contributes roles therefore declares their permissions through this capability or the Composer manifest. The full kernel-call-site table lives in `docs/specs/infrastructure.md`.

Catalogue composition runs after every provider's `register()` and before any
provider's `boot()` hook. Contributions must therefore be deterministic and
side-effect free. Framework packages with dynamic permission grammars expose
pure definition helpers; an application contributes the concrete definitions
from its canonical registered subject inventory and derives role grants through
the same helpers. Duplicate ids remain invalid even when their definitions are
byte-identical, preserving one accountable catalogue owner.

Agent-tool contribution uses the same cross-layer pattern. Application providers implement the Layer-5 `Waaseyaa\AI\Tools\ProvidesAgentToolsInterface`; the kernel detects that contract by string FQCN, sorts contributors by provider class, and hands them to the Foundation-owned `AcceptsAgentToolProvidersInterface` receiver before provider boot. `AiToolsServiceProvider` invokes each contributor once when the canonical registry singleton is first constructed. This keeps Foundation free of a compile-time Layer-5 dependency and keeps application tools independent of route registration.

API-catalog contribution stays entirely within Foundation-owned contracts. Installed providers implement `ProvidesApiCatalogEntriesInterface`; the kernel sorts contributors by provider class and hands them to each `AcceptsApiCatalogEntryProvidersInterface` receiver before provider boot. The API package validates, normalizes, and publishes the resulting public entries. Uninstalled packages cannot contribute, and providers must omit authenticated, administrative, write, or otherwise non-public surfaces.

AI-catalog contribution uses a parallel Foundation-owned contract because an
AI artifact identifier, media type, capabilities, and representative queries
are not RFC 9727 API endpoint relations. Installed providers implement
`ProvidesAiCatalogEntriesInterface`; the kernel injects them into
`AcceptsAiCatalogEntryProvidersInterface` receivers in the same deterministic
phase. Providers supply only deployment-neutral public artifact metadata. The
API package applies application-owned representative queries and publishes the
default-off experimental document. Installation can add a candidate artifact,
but application configuration remains the publication boundary.

Application-master rekey contribution follows the same pre-boot composition
pattern. Installed providers implement
`ProvidesApplicationMasterRekeyContributionsInterface`; on a full runtime boot
(never under restricted discovery), after every provider registers and before
any provider boots, `ApplicationMasterRekeyComposition::fromProviders()`
collects each contribution, requires adapters bound to the kernel's exact
database authority, unique adapter IDs, and exactly one active owner per
purpose, then freezes the purpose registry deterministically. Installs with no
contributors expose no registry. Composition conflict semantics and the
secret-custody runtime live in `docs/specs/infrastructure.md`.

## PackageManifest

### PackageManifest DTO

File: `packages/foundation/src/Discovery/PackageManifest.php`

```php
final class PackageManifest
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly array $providers = [],      // string[]
        public readonly array $commands = [],       // string[]
        public readonly array $routes = [],         // string[]
        public readonly array $migrations = [],     // [packageName => path]
        public readonly array $fieldTypes = [],     // [id => className]
        public readonly array $listeners = [],      // [eventClass => [{class, priority}]]
        public readonly array $middleware = [],      // [pipeline => [{class, priority}]]
        public readonly array $permissions = [],    // [id => {title, description?}]
        public readonly array $policies = [],       // [entityType => className]
    ) {}

    public static function fromArray(array $data): self;
    public function toArray(): array;
}
```

When deserializing from cache, `permissions` and `policies` are optional keys (`$data['permissions'] ?? []`). This supports backward-compatible cache evolution -- old cache files missing new keys will not break.

Required cache keys: `providers`, `commands`, `routes`, `migrations`, `field_types`, `listeners`, `middleware`.

### PackageManifestCompiler

File: `packages/foundation/src/Discovery/PackageManifestCompiler.php`

```php
final class PackageManifestCompiler
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $basePath,      // project root
        private readonly string $storagePath,   // storage/ directory
    );

    public function compile(): PackageManifest;
    public function compileAndCache(): PackageManifest;
    public function load(): PackageManifest;           // cache-first, compile on miss
}
```

**Compile pipeline:**

1. Read `vendor/composer/installed.json` for coarse-grained manifest data (providers, commands, routes, migrations, permissions)
2. Scan for Waaseyaa-namespaced classes using a two-tier strategy (see below)
3. Reflect each class, checking for discovery attributes
4. Discover `ScheduleEntriesInterface` implementors (a filter over the same scanned-class set, not a second scan — see "Single-scan memoization" below)
5. Sort middleware and listeners by priority (descending -- highest priority first)
6. Produce `PackageManifest` instance

**Class scanning strategy (step 2):**

The compiler uses a classmap-first approach with PSR-4 fallback:

1. **Classmap:** Read `vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php` and filter to eligible entries. An optimized Composer install makes this the fastest path.
2. **PSR-4 union:** Always read `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` and union eligible production namespaces with the classmap candidates. A routine non-optimized classmap is partial and must not suppress source discovery.

The PSR-4 path is protected by try-catch for corrupt map files.

**External extension policies and field types (#2314, #2786):** An installed package explicitly participates by carrying an array-shaped `extra.waaseyaa` block. Its production PSR-4 namespaces may live outside both `Waaseyaa\` and the root application's namespaces. The compiler scans those extension namespaces through the classmap and PSR-4 union for `PolicyAttribute` and `Waaseyaa\Field\Attribute\FieldType` only. Field types are recorded as exact `id => class` pairs; duplicate ids fail manifest compilation naming both classes, and the boot-scoped field manager revalidates that the class's live attribute still declares the cached id. A discovered field type may declare a transport-neutral `FieldValueKind` for upper-layer adapters; omission is allowed for non-wire consumers but GraphQL refuses it rather than guessing. This narrow path does not activate the extension's entity types, middleware, formatters, agent tools, agent definitions, or schedule entries; each of those surfaces requires its own documented extension contract.

**Single-scan memoization (WP7 audit remediation):** `scanClasses()` is memoized per `PackageManifestCompiler` instance (`private ?array $scannedClasses`). Without memoization, `compile()` ran the full classmap/PSR-4 scan and per-class `ReflectionClass` construction TWICE — once directly for the attribute-scan loop, once indirectly via `scanScheduleEntryClasses()` for the schedule-entries pass, since `filterDiscoveryClasses()` already admits `ScheduleEntriesInterface` implementors into the same discovery-class set the attribute loop iterates. `scanScheduleEntryClasses()` remains a separate logical pass over that shared set (a deliberate decision, not an oversight) — with `scanClasses()` memoized, it is a cheap in-memory `foreach`/`class_implements()` filter, not a second reflective scan. Compiler instances are created fresh per boot (one instance per request/CLI invocation), so the memo has no cross-request staleness window: it lives exactly as long as the one compile it serves.

**Corrupt-cache self-heal logging:** `load()`'s corrupt-cache recovery path (a cache file that throws on `require`, e.g. `<?php throw new \RuntimeException(...)`) logs a `warning()` naming the cache path, the exception class, and the exception message before falling through to recompile — an operator can see WHY a recompile happened instead of it being silent. A cache file that returns a wrong-shaped value without throwing (e.g. `<?php return "not an array";`) is a different code path (`is_array($data)` is simply false) and still self-heals without a warning, since no exception was thrown to log.

**Attribute scanning details:**

The compiler scans `Waaseyaa\` and root-application classes from the classmap/PSR-4 union. For each concrete (non-abstract, non-interface, non-trait) class:

| Attribute | What it discovers | How |
|-----------|------------------|-----|
| `Waaseyaa\Field\Attribute\FieldType` | Field type plugins | Exact `$instance->id` => class name; duplicate ids fail compilation |
| `Listener` | Event listeners | Reads `__invoke()` parameter type to determine event class; `$instance->priority` for ordering |
| `AsMiddleware` | Middleware | `$instance->pipeline` (http/event/job) + `$instance->priority` |
| `ContentEntityType` | Content entity types | Compiled to `attributeEntityTypes`, hydrated through `EntityType::fromClass()` when auto-registration is enabled |
| `AsEntityType` | Legacy entity factories | Deprecated compatibility path for `DefinesEntityType` implementations |
| `PolicyAttribute` | Access policies | `$instance->entityType` => class name |

**Cache output**: `storage/framework/packages.php`

```php
<?php return [
    'providers' => ['Waaseyaa\\Node\\NodeServiceProvider', ...],
    'commands' => [...],
    'routes' => [...],
    'migrations' => ['waaseyaa/node' => '/path/to/migrations/', ...],
    'field_types' => ['text' => 'Waaseyaa\\Field\\Plugin\\TextField', ...],
    'listeners' => [
        'Waaseyaa\\Entity\\Event\\EntitySaved' => [
            ['class' => '...', 'priority' => 100],
            ['class' => '...', 'priority' => 0],
        ],
    ],
    'middleware' => [
        'http' => [['class' => '...', 'priority' => 100], ...],
        'event' => [...],
        'job' => [...],
    ],
    'permissions' => [...],
    'policies' => [...],
];
```

**Dev vs. prod behavior:**

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Dev, no cache | `load()` compiles and writes cache |
| Dev, cache exists | `load()` reads from cache; corrupt cache triggers recompile |
| Prod | `waaseyaa optimize` pre-compiles; `load()` reads cache only |

**Atomic file write**: Cache is written via temp file + `rename()` to prevent serving partial writes. See `compileAndCache()`.

## Two Compilers

The system has two independent compilers, orchestrated by `waaseyaa optimize`:

| Compiler | Artifact | File |
|----------|----------|------|
| `PackageManifestCompiler` | `storage/framework/packages.php` | `packages/foundation/src/Discovery/PackageManifestCompiler.php` |
| `ConfigCacheCompiler` | `storage/framework/config.php` | `packages/config/src/Cache/ConfigCacheCompiler.php` |

`PackageManifestCompiler` handles middleware discovery via `#[AsMiddleware]` attribute scanning — middleware order is stored in the `middleware` key of `packages.php`. There is no separate middleware compiler.

**Compilation order**: Manifest first (config compiler may need it):

```
optimize:manifest -> optimize:config
```

### CLI commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `waaseyaa optimize` | Run all compilers in order |
| `waaseyaa optimize:clear` | Delete all cached artifacts |
| `waaseyaa optimize:manifest` | Compile package manifest only |
| `waaseyaa optimize:middleware` | Compile middleware pipelines only |
| `waaseyaa optimize:config` | Compile config cache only |

## Attribute Discovery

### Discovery attributes defined in Foundation

All discovery attributes live in `packages/foundation/src/Attribute/` and `packages/foundation/src/Event/Attribute/`:

```php
// packages/foundation/src/Attribute/AsFieldType.php (deprecated; ignored)
#[\Attribute(\Attribute::TARGET_CLASS)]
final class AsFieldType
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $id,
        public readonly string $label,
    ) {}
}

// packages/foundation/src/Attribute/AsEntityType.php
#[\Attribute(\Attribute::TARGET_CLASS)]
final class AsEntityType
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $id,
        public readonly string $label,
    ) {}
}

// packages/foundation/src/Attribute/AsMiddleware.php
#[\Attribute(\Attribute::TARGET_CLASS)]
final class AsMiddleware
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $pipeline,   // 'http', 'event', 'job'
        public readonly int $priority = 0,
    ) {}
}

// packages/foundation/src/Event/Attribute/Listener.php
#[\Attribute(\Attribute::TARGET_CLASS)]
final class Listener
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly int $priority = 0,
    ) {}
}
```

### Plugin system attribute discovery

The `packages/plugin/` package provides a separate attribute-based discovery system for extensible plugin types:

```php
// packages/plugin/src/Attribute/WaaseyaaPlugin.php
#[\Attribute(\Attribute::TARGET_CLASS)]
class WaaseyaaPlugin
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $id,
        public readonly string $label = '',
        public readonly string $description = '',
        public readonly string $package = '',
    ) {}
}
```

`AttributeDiscovery` scans directories for classes with a given attribute (configurable per plugin type), extracts `PluginDefinition` objects, and caches them via `DefaultPluginManager`. Field types wrap it with `FieldTypeDiscovery`: built-ins are directory-discovered, while downstream classes arrive from the compiled manifest as exact `id => class` pairs.

```php
// Discovery setup
$discovery = new AttributeDiscovery(
    directories: ['/path/to/packages/field/src/Plugin'],
    attributeClass: \Waaseyaa\Field\Attribute\FieldType::class,
);
$manager = new DefaultPluginManager($discovery, cache: $cacheBackend);
$definitions = $manager->getDefinitions();
$instance = $manager->createInstance('text');
```

### Cross-layer attribute scanning

File: `packages/foundation/src/Discovery/PackageManifestCompiler.php`

Foundation (layer 0) must never import from higher layers. When the compiler needs to scan for attributes defined in higher-layer packages (e.g., `PolicyAttribute` from the Access package), it uses string constants instead of `::class` references:

```php
private const POLICY_ATTRIBUTE = 'Waaseyaa\\Access\\Gate\\PolicyAttribute';

// In scanning code:
foreach ($ref->getAttributes(self::POLICY_ATTRIBUTE) as $attr) {
    $instance = $attr->newInstance();
    $policies[$instance->entityType] = $class;
}
```

`ReflectionClass::getAttributes()` accepts string class names, so no import is needed. This preserves strict layer discipline.

The same technique applies beyond attribute scanning wherever `PackageManifestCompiler` needs to test a class against a higher-layer type — e.g. `ENTITY_TYPE_DEFINITION_INTERFACE = 'Waaseyaa\\Entity\\DefinesEntityType'` (L1), used with `interface_exists()` / `is_subclass_of()` in `compile()`'s `AsEntityType` handling instead of an inline `\Waaseyaa\Entity\DefinesEntityType::class` reference. `::class` on an unimported FQCN is a compile-time string literal (PHP never autoloads to resolve it), so the string-constant form is behaviourally identical — it exists purely for convention consistency and to keep `bin/check-package-layers`' PL008 scan (see the infrastructure spec) from having to allowlist an inline `::class` token instead of a named constant.

## Layer Discipline

### Import rules

Foundation (layer 0) must never import from higher layers. This is enforced by convention and code review:

- Layer 0 (Foundation, Cache, Database) -> imports only PHP core and Symfony components
- Layer 1 (Core Data: Entity, Access, User, Config, Field) -> may import from layer 0
- Layer 2 (Content Types: Node, Taxonomy, Media) -> may import from layers 0-1
- Higher layers follow the same upward-only pattern

### Avoiding circular package dependencies

Key ownership boundaries:
- `packages/access/` owns `AccountInterface`
- `packages/user/` owns `User`, `AnonymousUser`
- `packages/access/` must NOT depend on `packages/user/`

Middleware needing an account type-hints `AccountInterface`, never concrete `AnonymousUser`.

### String constants for cross-layer attribute names

When layer 0 code needs to reference attribute classes from higher layers:

```php
// WRONG -- creates import dependency on higher layer
use Waaseyaa\Access\Gate\PolicyAttribute;

// CORRECT -- string constant, no import
private const POLICY_ATTRIBUTE = 'Waaseyaa\\Access\\Gate\\PolicyAttribute';
```

## Plugin System

### Core interfaces

File: `packages/plugin/src/PluginManagerInterface.php`

```php
interface PluginManagerInterface
{
    public function getDefinition(string $pluginId): PluginDefinition;
    public function getDefinitions(): array;
    public function hasDefinition(string $pluginId): bool;
    public function createInstance(string $pluginId, array $configuration = []): PluginInspectionInterface;
}
```

### PluginDefinition

File: `packages/plugin/src/Definition/PluginDefinition.php`

```php
final readonly class PluginDefinition
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $id,
        public string $label,
        public string $class,
        public string $description = '',
        public string $package = '',
        public array $metadata = [],
    ) {}
}
```

### DefaultPluginManager

File: `packages/plugin/src/DefaultPluginManager.php`

Caches plugin definitions via `CacheBackendInterface`. On cache miss, delegates to `PluginDiscoveryInterface` to scan. Uses `ContainerFactory` to instantiate plugin instances.

```php
class DefaultPluginManager implements PluginManagerInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        PluginDiscoveryInterface $discovery,
        ?CacheBackendInterface $cache = null,
        string $cacheKey = 'plugin_definitions',
        ?PluginFactoryInterface $factory = null,
    );

    public function clearCachedDefinitions(): void;
}
```

### Plugin base class

File: `packages/plugin/src/PluginBase.php`

```php
abstract class PluginBase implements PluginInspectionInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        protected readonly string $pluginId,
        protected readonly PluginDefinition $pluginDefinition,
        protected readonly array $configuration = [],
    );
}
```

Plugin classes extend `PluginBase` and receive their ID, definition, and configuration at construction time via `ContainerFactory`.

## Provider capability composition

Package discovery determines which service providers are installed; capability
composition determines whether that exact provider graph is safe to boot. After
all discovered providers register and before any provider boots,
`CapabilityRegistry` collects `ProvidesCapabilitiesInterface` declarations and
validates every `RequiresCapabilitiesInterface` requirement on ordinary runtime
boot. Restricted definition discovery (`restrictedDiscoveryOnly` /
`bootForSchemaSync` for `install:init`, `schema:sync`, and `migrate*`) skips
that live validation (#3064) so production installation can reach schema
preparation and CFG-02 genesis without resolving authority-dependent capability
publication. Ordinary production boot still validates and still refuses when no
active generation exists.

A declaration contains a stable capability ID, positive version, and authority
fingerprint. A requirement contains the accepted version range. Missing or
incompatible requirements fail with `RequiredCapabilityUnavailableException`.
Two providers may repeat a declaration only when version and authority
fingerprint are identical; divergent authorities fail composition. Capability
validation never selects an authority by registration order and never reaches a
network service, source forge, or CI provider.

The first governed capability is `configuration.authority.v1`. Configuration
consumers declare an exact version requirement, while the configuration
authority provider publishes the declaration that binds the active database,
generation, and selector provenance. This makes missing or split configuration
authority a deterministic pre-boot refusal.

### Optional package contributions

A required capability fails composition when absent. An **optional package
requirement** is the complementary contract for providers whose contribution
depends on a package their own manifest lists only under `suggest` or
`require-dev` (#2826). The provider implements
`RequiresOptionalPackagesInterface` and yields one `OptionalPackageRequirement`
per optional package: the Composer package name, a sentinel class, interface,
or enum FQCN that the optional package autoloads, and the purpose of the
contribution. The requirement is evaluated statically through
`OptionalPackageGate`, from the provider class name alone, so that:

- `PackageManifestCompiler` omits the provider from `console_command_providers`
  while any requirement is unsatisfied, even though the provider itself stays
  discovered and registered;
- the console runtime (`ConsoleApplicationFactory`) registers none of the
  provider's commands while any requirement is unsatisfied, so `list`, `help`,
  and invocation agree with discovery;
- the provider's own `register()` and `consoleCommands()` consult the same gate
  and contribute nothing while unsatisfied.

Composer autoload presence is the only install signal; no binding, stub, or
consumer-side filter stands in for the absent package, and a command that
would fail at first use is never advertised. The first adopter is
`Waaseyaa\CLI\Provider\AiServiceProvider`, which gates the `ai:*` operator
commands on `waaseyaa/ai-agent` with `AgentRunRepository` as the sentinel.
`Waaseyaa\CLI\Provider\OidcServiceProvider` (#2828) adopts the same contract
for the seven `oidc:*` operator commands, gated on `waaseyaa/oidc` with
`SigningKeyRepository` as the sentinel.
`packages/cli/tests/Unit/Provider/OptionalPackageImportDeclarationTest.php`
enforces that a cli provider importing a namespace outside cli's runtime
`require` closure declares that package through this contract, and
`tests/PackagedForm/check-cli-ai-commands-optional` /
`tests/PackagedForm/check-cli-oidc-commands-optional` prove the absent and
present consumers from installed bytes.

# Runtime capability composition

The compiled provider list is also the deterministic runtime order for typed
capability contribution. `ProviderCapabilitySource::implementing()` filters
that live list without re-instantiating providers. Package-specific registries
must define collision semantics explicitly; the auth extension registry uses
exclusive named slots and refuses a second owner with both provider classes in
the diagnostic.

## Route participation bootstrap contract (ROUTE-METADATA-01)

`ContributesRouteMetadataInterface` is a separate Foundation capability; it does
not add a required method to `ServiceProviderInterface`. Its pure declaration
path takes precedence over a retained legacy `routes()` override.

The standalone route participation compiler classifies inherited base no-op,
pure capability and actual legacy overrides. Bootstrap admission compares the
ordered roster, effective method owner, transitive parent/trait/interface source
digests, trait aliases and compiler/contract identity. Records contain symbolic
names and content hashes, never absolute source locations. Missing, malformed
or stale records refuse admission. Reflection and source reads belong only to
bootstrap; a metadata consumer cannot refresh the token.

`PackageManifest` persists the raw inventory under `route_participation`.
Older caches omit that optional field and remain readable, with an unavailable
route inventory. Source compilation may record an unavailable inventory when
ordinary discovery encounters a missing or unclassifiable provider; existing
HTTP compatibility and missing-provider diagnostics remain in effect.
Malformed route-only cache shape is normalized to an unavailable marker; it
does not trigger generic corrupt-cache recovery or overwrite cached evidence.

Kernel bootstrap admits the raw inventory before provider registration, then
compares its ordered roster to the providers actually registered. The token is
accessible only after complete runtime boot. Inspection never recompiles a stale
record. A restricted or previously failed kernel cannot become runtime route
authority, including after an ordinary boot retry; create a new runtime kernel.
The token is participation evidence, not a completed route snapshot. Finalized
input projection and complete kernel route-source admission are implemented;
consumer adoption remains pending.
See [route-metadata.md](route-metadata.md) and the execution ledger.

## Route input handoff during provider boot

The kernel supplies one `RouteExposureInputs` instance through the provider registry's optional trailing argument. `ProviderRegistryKernelServices` returns that exact instance for its class identifier. Bare registry callers may omit it. The API provider publishes the effective map from its existing exposure policy during ordinary boot. After all providers and finalizers complete, the kernel freezes the publication against the finalized entity roster; missing, duplicate or stale publication refuses canonical route inputs. An admitted roster without the API provider produces an all-false exposure map.

Route participation compilation admits the known neutral metadata protocol classes and projector during bootstrap source validation. Projection and subsequent inspection do not discover or autoload classes. This handoff neither invokes route contributors nor changes legacy route registration. Package presence alone does not establish active API participation.

The admitted protocol roster includes `FoundationRouteDefinitions`, whose source digest participates in compiler identity. After input freezing the kernel admits this complete builtin/terminal authority and the exact registered provider/context roster to its lazy composition epoch. Bootstrap does not invoke contributors. Legacy classifications refuse complete snapshot inspection without any hook call; declarative providers are collected once only when the snapshot is requested.

Explicit handler service admission enumerates existing kernel/provider binding keys without resolving them. Numeric-string service IDs remain supported: PHP stores these as integer array keys, so the provider interface documents `array-key` and the execution adapter restores string IDs. Kernel keys precede provider keys; the first provider wins duplicates. Provider factories preserve their declared lifetime and a selected failure never falls through to another provider. The existing generic container's compatibility lookup is separate from this explicit execution path.


HTTP consumes the admitted participation token through a kernel-local execution
projection. Fully declarative cohorts reuse the kernel snapshot; mixed cohorts
use one path per provider and continue to refuse canonical inspection. HTTP
binding admission checks explicit registered keys without constructing handlers;
terminal dispatch owns resolution. No manifest refresh or legacy fallback is
used for unknown or poisoned admission. See [route-metadata.md](route-metadata.md).


## ROUTE-METADATA-01 canonical inspection

ProviderRegistry passes an optional lazy RouteSnapshot accessor into the kernel
services bus. AbstractKernel supplies its guarded getRouteSnapshot() accessor;
restricted/failed/preboot/legacy states therefore propagate existing refusals.
The reserved bus entry precedes provider overrides, reads custody every time and
never caches away lifecycle checks. Existing construction callers may omit it.
This handoff does not collect declarations during provider registration.
