# Workflow governance (anchor-issue + design-first)

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-10 - Spec Kitty retirement: governance rewritten around GitHub anchor issues and the design-first flow. Spec Kitty (missions, work packages, .kittify/, spec-kitty CLI) is retired; its historical artifacts remain under kitty-specs/ and in git history. The project charter was relocated to docs/governance/charter.md. -->

**Planning and execution** for substantive work follow the **design-first flow**: brainstorm → design/spec in `docs/specs/` → written plan → TDD implementation → code review → verification. Multi-PR efforts are anchored by a **GitHub anchor issue** (e.g. CW-v1's #1920) that records scope, work-package breakdown, and descope decisions; every PR in the effort references it. **`docs/specs/`** remains the contract layer agents read from disk.

**GitHub** is the execution and visibility surface: issues (anchor issues, M11 governed-change filings), pull requests, Actions, releases, and security. CI and merge reality live on GitHub.

> **Spec Kitty is retired** (2026-07-06). Do not run `spec-kitty` commands or consult `.kittify/` state. Historical mission artifacts are preserved read-only under `kitty-specs/`; the charter formerly at `.kittify/charter/charter.md` now lives at [`docs/governance/charter.md`](../governance/charter.md).

## Versioning Model

Framework **revision identity** (monorepo Git SHA vs split `waaseyaa/*` packages, golden SHA for apps, `bin/waaseyaa-version`) is documented in [version-provenance.md](./version-provenance.md). Root `composer.json` `"version"` in the monorepo is not a published semver line.

**Per-site consumer audits** (repeatable convergence checklist, artifact location, roster order): [per-site-convergence-audit.md](./per-site-convergence-audit.md).

The Waaseyaa Framework and Minoo (the flagship consumer app) version independently.

- **Framework versions** represent platform contract stability (ingestion envelope, schema registry, ACL substrate, operator diagnostics, CI gates).
- **App versions** (Minoo etc.) represent product feature maturity.
- The framework is the platform; apps are consumers. App versioning is constrained by framework releases, not the reverse.
- The framework passed v1.0 after platform contracts (ingestion envelope, schema registry, ACL, versioning, CI gates) were stabilized through v0.7–v0.12. Post-v1.0 milestones follow semantic intent: minor versions add capabilities (search, revisions, workspaces), v2.0 introduces breaking schema changes.

**Update this table whenever milestones are added, closed, or redescribed.**

## GitHub issues (optional)

GitHub issues are not organized into Track milestones. A standalone issue (community visibility, Dependabot, M11 templates, or contributor preference) stands on its own — no enforced taxonomy or assignment is required. The **Framework Milestones** table above is the semantic capability narrative; **anchor issues** are the execution map for multi-PR efforts. The Track 1–5 GitHub milestones from earlier 2026 are retained on GitHub for historical context but are no longer load-bearing for workflow decisions.

**Dependabot and dependency PRs:** **Pull requests** that only bump dependencies may omit `(#N)` in the title when there is no tracking issue; if there is a chore or security issue, link it per rule #3.

## Milestone Narrative Arc

**Pre-v1 (platform foundation):**
- v0.7 — make the platform usable
- v0.8 — define the platform contract
- v0.9 — expand the platform contract (tenant onboarding, security)
- v0.10 — polish the admin experience
- v0.11 — ingestion pipeline foundation
- v0.12 — operator diagnostics and health

**v1.x (platform capabilities):**
- v1.0 — lock the platform contract
- v1.1–v1.3 — stabilization, GraphQL, cleanup
- v1.4 — unify storage under DBAL
- v1.5 — complete the admin surface
- v1.6 — add search (SQLite FTS5)
- v1.7 — add revision tracking
- v1.8 — multi-project/workspace support
- v1.9 — production-grade queue backend

**v2.x (breaking changes):**
- v2.0 — automatic schema evolution (field-definition diffing, migration generation)

## The 4 Workflow Rules

### Blocking fresh-install cutover invariant

The required `ci/unit-tests` context runs `CutoverFreshInstallSmokeTest` on a clean SQLite database through the real `db:init` path. The smoke must keep `schema:check` green, persist and render an import-derived bundle field from a separate HTTP process, and traverse a freshly-created relationship through SSR. Upgraded fixtures do not substitute for this fresh-install boundary.

### 1. Substantive work begins with a design and an anchor issue
Do not drive multi-step implementation from a blank prompt. Multi-PR efforts open a **GitHub anchor issue** recording intent, work-package breakdown, and decisions (descopes, deferrals land as issue comments), and follow the design-first flow: spec in `docs/specs/` first, then a written plan, then TDD implementation. **M11 governed-change** and similar templates keep the GitHub filing issue as the audit front door — link it from the anchor issue or PR body so traceability stays intact.

### 2. GitHub issues are lightweight
Not every change needs an issue — a single self-contained PR may stand alone if its body explains itself. When filed, issues are pure tracking — no enforced milestone or taxonomy. The **Framework milestones** table and narrative in this document describe **capability intent** (v1.x / v2.0); **anchor issues** are the execution map for multi-PR efforts.

### 3. PRs must be traceable
Every PR must link **what it delivers**: `Closes #N` for a complete deliverable, `Part of #N` for one PR in an anchored effort, with `#N` in the title (e.g. `feat(#1920): …`). Use `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Dependency-only PRs may follow the Dependabot exception above.

### 4. Read context before generating work
At session start under an ongoing effort, read the anchor issue (including its comment trail — descopes and deferrals live there) and the relevant `docs/specs/` contracts before generating work.

## Drift Detection

**Specs:** `tools/drift-detector.sh` and manual reads of `docs/specs/` — see [ops/observability/drift-detection.md](../../ops/observability/drift-detection.md).

## Composer Manifest Policy (Codified + Gated)

`composer.json` consistency is a hard policy enforced by `bin/check-composer-policy` in hooks and CI.

Policy rules:

1. `config.sort-packages` is required and must be `true` in all first-party `composer.json` manifests (CP001).
2. `@dev` constraints for `waaseyaa/*` are forbidden in root `composer.json` and in `packages/*/composer.json` (CP002). The root manifest is published to Packagist as `waaseyaa/framework` and consumers cannot resolve `@dev`. `examples/` and `docs/examples/` are consumer demos that track local path repos at dev-main and may use `@dev`.
3. Wildcard constraints for internal `waaseyaa/*` packages are forbidden everywhere (CP003).
4. `waaseyaa/core` must keep optional observability/dev packages (`waaseyaa/debug`, `waaseyaa/telescope`, `waaseyaa/testing`) out of `require`; they belong in `suggest` (CP004).
5. Cross-package constraints in `packages/*` and `skeleton/composer.json` must include an explicit pre-release floor (alpha/beta/rc/dev), e.g. `^0.1.0-alpha.150`, so Composer cannot resolve a stale sibling missing required methods (CP005).
6. The root `composer.json` (published as `waaseyaa/framework`) uses `self.version` for all `waaseyaa/*` siblings (CP006). `self.version` resolves to `dev-main` against local path repos and to the exact tag version (e.g. `0.1.0-alpha.170`) when crawled by Packagist, giving consumers exact-matching siblings without a release-time rewrite step. `self.version` is forbidden outside root since non-root manifests have no parent metapackage version to bind against.
7. Every package-local `repositories` entry of type `path` must resolve to a `waaseyaa/*` package named in that manifest's `require` or `require-dev`, and every such internal requirement must have the matching path repository (CP007). This keeps package-local installs reproducible in the monorepo without accumulating stale or one-way repository metadata.

> CP006 was filed as #1382 after alpha.170 shipped to Packagist with unresolvable `@dev` constraints in the root artifact.

## Cutting Releases

The canonical release path is the `Cut Release` workflow (`.github/workflows/release-cut.yml`, `workflow_dispatch` trigger). It mirrors what `scripts/release.sh` did locally — validate semver, verify `[Unreleased]` has content, mutate CHANGELOG, commit, tag, push — but runs in CI with no interactive prompts and no operator-on-laptop dependency.

```sh
gh workflow run release-cut.yml -f version=v0.1.0-alpha.172
```

Or use the GitHub Actions UI ("Run workflow" → enter version).

The workflow:

1. Validates semver shape (same regex as the legacy script).
2. Guards `v1.0*` tags against missing `release-approvals/v1.0.approved` (same gate `split.yml` runs after the fact — fails earlier).
3. **Gate 1: requires green CI on the release base.** `bin/wait-for-green-ci` polls the Actions API for a completed, successful `ci.yml` run at main HEAD. A red base fails the cut before anything is mutated.
4. Verifies the tag does not already exist (locally or on origin).
5. Verifies `CHANGELOG.md` has a `[Unreleased]` section with content.
6. Mutates the changelog: renames `[Unreleased]` → `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, inserts fresh `[Unreleased]`; syncs internal `waaseyaa/*` constraints; stamps `VERSION`.
7. Commits as `github-actions[bot]` and pushes the release commit to a throwaway gate branch (`release-cut/<version>`) — **not** to main.
8. **Gate 2: requires green CI on the exact commit being tagged.** Dispatches `ci.yml` on the gate branch (it has a `workflow_dispatch` trigger for this) and waits for a green conclusion at the release commit's SHA.
9. Only then creates the annotated tag and pushes main fast-forward + tag in one **atomic** push using `SPLIT_GITHUB_TOKEN`. The gate branch is deleted either way.

**A tag cannot exist without green Linux CI at that exact SHA.** This is the systemic fix from the alpha.200–202 red-at-tag post-mortem: red jobs (the alpha.200 b1 interface stub, the alpha.202 integration-test misses, the three-release-red `ci/skeleton-create-project` job) can no longer ride into a tagged release, and there is no "the fix will go out in the next cut" path — the cut simply refuses.

Failure recovery is clean by construction: if either gate fails, main is untouched and no tag exists. Fix main (normal commits, normal CI), then re-run the cut with the same version. If the final atomic push is rejected because main advanced during the gate, nothing was tagged — re-run the cut.

The push must use the `SPLIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` PAT, not the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, because tag pushes by `GITHUB_TOKEN` do **not** trigger downstream workflows — and `split.yml` + `packagist-update.yml` are exactly what we need to fire.

**Local gate runs are advisory only.** Pre-cut checks that matter run Linux-side in CI; a green local run (especially on Windows) proves nothing about the release — Windows masked both the `packages/`-scoped grep miss and platform-conditional test failures during the alpha.200–202 cuts, and local git hooks may not even be installed (`core.hooksPath` is unset on fresh clones). Never treat a local `composer verify`/phpunit pass as authorization to cut; the Actions API is the authority, and `bin/wait-for-green-ci` is how every release path consults it.

The legacy `scripts/release.sh` local-release script has been **removed** (alpha.234) — the `Cut Release` workflow is the only supported path. It could not CI-prove the exact release commit the way the workflow's gate branch does (it only enforced Gate 1 on the base via `bin/wait-for-green-ci`), and a local cut on Windows was an active footgun. There is no local fallback: cut releases through CI.

Filed as #1385 after the alpha.171 cut for #1382 surfaced the manual-release friction; CI gates added after the alpha.200–202 red-at-tag incident (2026-06-10).

## Release Tag Parity

Release tags must split to every package repo that is represented under `packages/*/composer.json`.

- Guard script: `bin/check-release-tag-parity`
- Primary enforcement: `.github/workflows/split.yml` — `verify-tag-parity` after the split matrix, then `publish-github-release` (so parity always runs before the monorepo GitHub Release exists)
- Recovery / backfill: `.github/workflows/github-release.yml` (`workflow_dispatch` only; optional parity preflight + release for an existing tag)

This prevents publishing a framework tag where a required split package tag is missing (the failure class that left consumers unable to resolve `waaseyaa/core` when one required package had not been published).

Failure format is machine- and human-readable, including:
- file path
- violated rule id
- current value
- expected value

The top-level M11 post-execution governance baseline is [m11-post-execution-governance-bootstrap.md](./m11-post-execution-governance-bootstrap.md). Governed changes enter that loop through [the governed-change issue template](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/m11-governed-change.md) (GitHub as **audit front door**); link the filing issue from the anchor issue or PR when both exist. This workflow spec is the repo-local backlink to that artifact. The operating loop itself is [m11-steady-state-conformance-loop.md](./m11-steady-state-conformance-loop.md), and steady-state drift scans and C17+ logging use [m11-periodic-drift-scan-protocol.md](./m11-periodic-drift-scan-protocol.md) and the [M11 drift-scan log issue template](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/m11-drift-scan-log.md).
