# Schema evolution v2.0 — SchemaDiff engine (design)

**Status:** Design draft (Phase 1 — WP01 / [#522](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/522))  
**Epic:** [#529](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/529) Schema Evolution v2.0  
**Mission (authoritative checkpoint):** `kitty-specs/529-schema-evolution-v2/spec.md`  
**Architecture rule:** Waaseyaa owns diffing rules, migration generation, and safety gates; **applications** own timing and operational rollout of generated schema changes.

This document is the **canonical design contract** for the SchemaDiff pivot. It does not prescribe implementation filenames or package layout; those follow in [#521](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/521). Until implementation lands, **no behavior change** is implied for production installs.

---

## 1. Goals

1. Represent structural schema change as **immutable, typed, serializable data** (SchemaDiff), not as ad-hoc imperative SQL in application code.
2. Compile diffs to **executable plans** (SQLite first), with a **deterministic** ordering story and **explicit** safety gates for destructive operations.
3. Extend the **migration ledger** so applied work is **auditable** (checksums, optional diff hashes) and **verifiable** against live databases.
4. Support **execution modes**: apply, dry-run, verify, and bounded replay — without “run once and hope” semantics.
5. Evolve **Composer manifest** discovery toward **declarative, ordered** migration registration while **coexisting** with the [#1286](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/1286) string-path convention until a deprecation window closes.
6. **Coexist** with the existing `Migration` / `Migrator` / `MigrationLoader` stack until a deliberate deprecation phase; no big-bang removal.

## 2. Related specifications

| Document | Relevance |
|----------|-----------|
| [field/column-derivation.md](./field/column-derivation.md) | Column specs for field types → storage columns; compiler and diff producers **must** stay aligned with this contract. |
| [infrastructure.md](./infrastructure.md) | Current `Migrator`, `MigrationRepository`, `MigrationLoader`, package-declared migrations (`extra.waaseyaa.migrations`). |
| [bundle-scoped-storage.md](./bundle-scoped-storage.md) | `{base}__{bundle}` subtables; entity-level vs bundle-level diff scope. |
| [workflow.md](./workflow.md) | Semantic milestone v2.0; PR traceability to #521 / #522 / #518 / #529. |

---

## 3. SchemaDiff data model

### 3.1 Design principles

- **Pure data at the core boundary:** SchemaDiff and atomic operations contain **no SQL strings**. SQL appears only at the **compiler output** seam (see §6).
- **PHP 8.4-native:** Prefer **`readonly` classes**, **constructor-promoted properties**, **`enum`-backed** discriminated operation kinds where it improves exhaustiveness and serialization contracts.
- **Immutability:** Every operation type is immutable after construction; “chaining” produces new instances or new `CompositeDiff` containers.
- **Serialization:** Types SHOULD be JSON-serializable (for fixtures, CI, and checksum canonicalization) using a **stable** field order and normalized encoding (ADR to fix exact JSON rules).
- **Equality / hashing:** Two diffs that represent the same intent MUST compare equal under a defined canonicalization and produce the same **checksum** input (§8).

### 3.2 Column and index specs (shared vocabulary)

Column specifications at the diff boundary SHOULD reuse the same **semantic** shape as storage today: `type`, optional `length`, `not null`, `default`, etc., aligned with [`column-derivation.md`](./field/column-derivation.md) and `SqlSchemaHandler::deriveColumnSpec()` outcomes so there is a single conceptual mapping from **field definition** → **column spec** → **compiler**.

**Open (human):** Whether the diff layer references `FieldDefinitionInterface` shapes, a dedicated `ColumnSpec` DTO, or a normalized array — pick one and document in ADR before Phase 2.

### 3.3 Atomic operations (minimum set)

Each operation is a **named, readonly** type (exact class names TBD in implementation). The list below is the **minimum** supported set for v2; extensions require ADR.

| Operation | Fields (conceptual) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **AddColumn** | `table`, `column`, `spec` | Additive; default gate: allowed. |
| **AlterColumn** | `table`, `column`, `new_spec` | May be restricted on SQLite (rewrite-table semantics); policy may require explicit migration split. |
| **DropColumn** | `table`, `column` | **Destructive**; blocked by default or requires explicit danger flag at plan level. |
| **AddIndex** | `table`, `columns[]`, optional `name`, `unique` | Composite columns allowed. |
| **DropIndex** | `table`, `name` or `columns[]` identity | Resolver defines how anonymous indexes are addressed on SQLite. |
| **AddForeignKey** | `table`, constraint definition (referencing table/columns, ON DELETE/UPDATE) | SQLite vs MySQL/Postgres capability matrix in ADR; unsupported combos must fail at compile time with a clear code. |
| **DropForeignKey** | `table`, constraint `name` | Same as above. |
| **RenameColumn** | `table`, `from`, `to` | Never infer rename from “drop + add” without explicit op. |
| **RenameTable** | `from`, `to` | Rare for entity types; supported for completeness and tooling. |

### 3.4 Composite and scoped diffs

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **CompositeDiff** | Ordered, immutable list of atomic operations. **Transaction boundary:** one `CompositeDiff` applied in a **single** DB transaction unless an ADR splits unsafe bundles (e.g. SQLite table rebuild). |
| **EntityLevelDiff** | Binds to one `entity_type_id` (logical): targets **base table** `entity_type_id` and any **known** `{base}__{bundle}` subtables per [bundle-scoped-storage.md](./bundle-scoped-storage.md). Producers MAY emit only `CompositeDiff` internally; the entity wrapper carries metadata for verify and UI. |
| **BundleLevelDiff** | Subset of entity scope: exactly one bundle’s subtable (and optional base-table touches if required by FK rules — document if forbidden). |

**Ordering:** Atomic ops inside `CompositeDiff` MUST be in **apply order** (compiler may not reorder without explicit pass). Topological dependencies between ops (e.g. add column before index on that column) are the **producer’s** responsibility; the compiler validates and fails fast on illegal sequences.

---

## 4. MigrationInterface v2 (authoring contract)

### 4.1 Interface shape (design-level)

- **`MigrationInterfaceV2`** (name illustrative): implemented by **`readonly` concrete classes** (final where possible).
- **No `up()` / `down()`** on this interface. Legacy imperative migrations keep `Migration::up` / `down` until deprecated.
- **Payload:** Each v2 migration holds **either** a single `SchemaDiff` root **or** an immutable `list` of atomic ops / `CompositeDiff` — **no** SQL, **no** `SchemaBuilder` callbacks inside the type.
- **Optional `MigrationPlan`:** Separates **intent** (immutable diff + metadata) from **materialization** (compiled steps for apply vs dry-run). Dry-run consumes the same plan without mutating ledger.

### 4.2 Metadata (required for ledger and ordering)

Each v2 migration value MUST expose (names illustrative):

| Metadata | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `migration_id` | Stable string ID (not only Composer display name); used in ledger and verify. |
| `package` | Composer package name (`waaseyaa/…`). |
| `dependencies` | Ordered list of **package names** or **migration_id** strings this entry must run after (extends today’s `$after` semantics conceptually). |

### 4.3 Interop with compilation

- v2 types **do not** execute DB I/O.
- A **compiler service** (Phase 3) accepts `SchemaDiff` + **platform** + optional **connection capabilities** and returns a **`CompiledMigrationPlan`**: ordered steps (e.g. SQL DTOs or DBAL operations) — the only layer where SQL is produced.

---

## 5. Diff → SQL compiler contract (SQLite-first)

### 5.1 Inputs

- **Root:** `SchemaDiff` (or `CompositeDiff`).
- **Platform:** `sqlite` in v1 of compiler; `mysql` / `postgres` later behind explicit platform enum and capability tables.
- **Options:** Strict vs permissive mode; whether to allow destructive ops; max operation count (DoS guard).

### 5.2 Outputs

- **`CompiledMigrationPlan`** (immutable): ordered list of **atomic executable steps**.
- Each step is a **narrow DTO** (e.g. `ExecuteStatement`, `CreateTable`, `AlterTableAddColumn`) — **not** arbitrary strings from callers. Only the compiler constructs these.
- **Determinism:** Same `SchemaDiff` + same platform + same compiler version ⇒ **byte-identical** ordered steps (required for golden tests and `diff_hash`).

### 5.3 Validation rules (compiler gates)

- Reject unknown operation kinds.
- Reject destructive ops when policy forbids (`DropColumn`, `DropForeignKey`, etc.).
- Reject FK definitions SQLite cannot enforce (document matrix).
- Detect illegal ordering (index before column) and fail with structured errors (codes suitable for operator diagnostics).

### 5.4 Alignment with existing storage

- Column type semantics MUST remain consistent with **`deriveColumnSpec()`** / [`column-derivation.md`](./field/column-derivation.md).
- Entity / bundle table naming MUST match [`bundle-scoped-storage.md`](./bundle-scoped-storage.md) and `SqlSchemaHandler` naming rules (`{base}__{bundle}`, separator invariants).

---

## 6. Ledger contract (extensions)

Today (`waaseyaa_migrations`): `migration`, `package`, `batch`, `ran_at` (see [infrastructure.md](./infrastructure.md) § Migrator / MigrationRepository).

### 6.1 New or renamed columns (design intent)

| Field | Type (illustrative) | Purpose |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| `migration_id` | `VARCHAR(255)` | Stable logical id for v2 (and legacy rows may mirror current `migration` string). **Human decision:** one column vs overload `migration`; ADR must pick to avoid duplicate truth. |
| `checksum` | `VARCHAR(64)` or `BINARY` | Hash of **canonical serialized** diff (or v1 migration source file hash for legacy) at apply time. |
| `diff_hash` | `VARCHAR(64)` nullable | Hash of **compiled plan** (normalized SQL DTO sequence) for verify mode. |
| `applied_at` | timestamp | Same semantics as current `ran_at` OR rename in ADR with migration path. |

### 6.2 Rules

- On **apply**, persist `checksum` (and `diff_hash` if computed) **after** successful transaction commit.
- **Verify** recomputes expected hashes from **registered** definitions + ledger and compares to live introspection snapshot.
- **Replay:** **Production** MUST NOT silently re-apply the same `migration_id` with a **different** `checksum`. **Development** MAY allow `replay` on scratch DB only (explicit CLI flag, documented risk).

### 6.3 Backfill

Existing rows lack `checksum` / `diff_hash`. **ADR:** sentinel value, nullable columns, or one-time backfill script; verify mode defines behavior for “legacy unknown.”

---

## 7. Execution model

### 7.1 Apply

- Extends current **`Migrator::run`** semantics: a **merged ordered graph** of **legacy** `Migration` instances and **v2** compiled plans (exact merge algorithm ADR — e.g. all legacy for a batch, then v2, or interleaved by migration_id sort + dependency edges only if safe).
- One **batch number** per successful apply batch (unchanged conceptually).

### 7.2 Dry-run

- Compiles `SchemaDiff` → `CompiledMigrationPlan` **without** committing and **without** ledger writes.
- Emits **human-readable** summary and **machine-readable** JSON (schema TBD) for CI and operators.

### 7.3 Verify

- Inputs: live connection + **expected** schema fingerprint (from entity types + field registry + ledger history, per ADR).
- Output: pass/fail + **diagnostic codes** (align with operator diagnostics conventions where applicable).
- **Production output** MUST NOT leak raw filesystem paths in error strings (see mission Phase 5).

### 7.4 Replay

- **Dev:** optional command to drop/recreate scratch DB and re-run full chain (explicit).
- **Prod:** no implicit replay; any repair path is operator-driven and documented.

### 7.5 CLI surface

- Prefer **flags on existing** `migrate` / `migrate:status` (`--dry-run`, `--verify`) unless an ADR introduces new command names — avoid duplicate surfaces.

---

## 8. Composer manifest evolution

### 8.1 Today (#1286)

```json
"extra": {
  "waaseyaa": {
    "migrations": "migrations"
  }
}
```

`PackageManifestCompiler` records `packageName => string path`. `MigrationLoader` resolves the directory and loads `*.php` files in **lexicographic** order.

### 8.2 Target (Phase 6)

Ordered **array** of entries (namespace and/or path strings):

```json
"extra": {
  "waaseyaa": {
    "migrations": [
      "Waaseyaa\\Groups\\Migrations\\v1",
      "../patches/schema-v2"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Semantics:**

- **Array order** is the **authoritative** apply order within that package (before cross-package `$after` / dependency merge).
- **Entries:** FQCN namespace roots for class-discovered v2 migrations **and/or** filesystem path strings during transition — exact discovery rules in ADR (no class-string **registries** stored as opaque JSON blobs without validation).

### 8.3 Coexistence rule

- **String** value remains valid indefinitely until deprecation is announced; **array** form is additive.
- `PackageManifest` typing must represent `string|list<string>` without losing order (PHP `array` list preservation).

---

## 9. Coexistence with the current migration engine

| Layer | Rule |
|-------|------|
| **Legacy `Migration`** | Continues to run unchanged; `up`/`down` + `SchemaBuilder` remain supported. |
| **v2 migrations** | Run through the same **ledger** and **batch** concepts; different code path in `Migrator` (or adapter) once implemented. |
| **Ordering** | Legacy package topological sort **extends** to include v2 nodes; **edges** defined by `dependencies` / `$after` must not introduce cycles (fail boot or fail migrate with clear error). |
| **`ensureTable()`** | Remains the kernel path for **base** entity tables; v2 does **not** replace it in Phase 1–3. v2 handles **additive and evolved** schema beyond that contract per epic acceptance. |
| **Producers** | Field-definition diff engine (future) may emit `SchemaDiff` that compile to SQL **or** to calls that align with `SqlSchemaHandler` where appropriate — convergence is incremental. |

---

## 10. Non-goals (explicit)

The following are **out of scope** for initial delivery unless the epic is explicitly expanded:

1. **Timestamp-prefixed** migration filenames as the **source of truth** for ordering (lexicographic sort is not a product feature; ordered manifest + deps are).
2. **Folder scanning** as the **only** discovery mechanism long-term — Phase 6 replaces with declarative manifest; until then, #1286 directory loading remains for string paths.
3. **Imperative SQL** or string-concatenated DDL **inside** SchemaDiff or `MigrationInterfaceV2` implementations from integrators — only the **compiler** emits SQL DTOs.
4. **Global mutable state** during diff or compile (no static caches of connection or config).
5. **Class-string registries** without validation (no unchecked `::class` strings from untrusted JSON).
6. **Admin UI** for migrations.
7. **Automatic apply** on HTTP kernel boot.
8. **Replacing `ensureTable()`** in one shot for all entity types.

---

## 11. Safety gates (policy layer)

Design-level requirements (implementation in [#521](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/521)):

- **Classify** operations: additive / ambiguous / destructive.
- **Default:** additive allowed; destructive **blocked** unless an explicit operator flag or signed “danger accepted” channel (ADR).
- **Rename-like** patterns (drop + add with compatible types) MUST either be rejected or normalized to **RenameColumn** — no silent coalescing without human-visible warning.

---

## 12. Test strategy ([#518](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/518))

### 12.1 Unit

- **Diff algebra:** equality, hashing, composite ordering, immutability.
- **Compiler golden files:** `SchemaDiff` → SQLite `CompiledMigrationPlan` snapshots (stable SQL or stable DTO JSON); version golden files when compiler output intentionally changes.
- **Policy:** destructive ops blocked unless flag set.

### 12.2 Idempotency

- Applying the **same** compiled plan twice: second run is **no-op** at ledger + DB level (or explicit “already applied” without error — pick one in ADR).

### 12.3 Integration

- SQLite file or `:memory:`: register entity type change → produce diff → compile → apply → introspect schema.
- **Bundle subtable** scenarios per [bundle-scoped-storage.md](./bundle-scoped-storage.md).

### 12.4 Cross-database

- **CI default:** SQLite only.
- **MySQL / Postgres:** optional matrix job when compiler gains platforms; same `SchemaDiff` may produce different compiled plans — separate golden files per platform if needed.

### 12.5 Round-trip (limited)

- Where feasible: introspected schema → diff against expected model. **Non-goal:** perfect round-trip for all SQLite DDL edge cases in v1.

---

## 13. Acceptance mapping (#529 epic)

From GitHub epic: child issues **#522** (this document + refinements), **#521** (implementation), **#518** (tests) complete; supported changes produce **deterministic** output; **unsafe** changes blocked or surfaced with operator-facing detail.

---

## 14. Open questions and ambiguities (human decisions before Phase 2)

1. **`migration_id` vs current `migration` column:** Rename vs new column vs overload string format — affects migrations table migration and verify queries.
2. **Checksum algorithm:** SHA-256 vs BLAKE3 vs truncated hash; canonical JSON rules for diff serialization.
3. **`MigrationPlan` vs single `CompositeDiff`:** Whether the plan type is always a composite root or a tagged union including “empty plan.”
4. **Merge algorithm** for legacy + v2 in one batch: strict “legacy first” vs interleaved by explicit `(package, migration_id)` total order — affects reproducibility.
5. **SQLite `AlterColumn`:** Support level (full rewrite vs subset); which alter shapes v1 refuses and surfaces as “manual intervention required.”
6. **FK on SQLite:** Which referential actions are supported in v1 compiler vs explicitly unsupported.
7. **EntityLevelDiff producer:** Lives in `entity-storage` vs `foundation` vs new package — layer graph must be respected ([CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) layer table).
8. **CLI UX:** Single `migrate --dry-run` for both legacy and v2 or separate subcommand — product preference.
9. **Deprecation calendar** for directory-only `migrations` string paths — communicate in CHANGELOG and [workflow.md](./workflow.md).

**Resolutions for each item are ratified in §15 (locked 2026-05-02).** §14 remains the question list for traceability; binding decisions are §15.

## 15. Ratified Resolutions (Q1–Q9)

**Status: RATIFIED — 2026-05-02.** This section locks the architectural decisions for Q1–Q9. Each entry below is a **finalized resolution** binding on Phase 2+ implementation. Changes to any ratified resolution require a new ADR and an explicit overturn note in this document; they may not be relitigated implicitly during WP execution.

### Q1 — `migration_id` vs current `migration` column

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **A** | Add a parallel `migration_id` column; keep `migration` as display-only. |
| **B** | Retain **`migration` as the sole canonical ledger key** (same uniqueness semantics as today); v2 entries use the same stable string pattern (`{package}:{logical_slug}`). |

**Ratified resolution (2026-05-02):** **B.** Avoid a second identifier column and a wide data migration on every install. v2 registrations MUST supply a **stable, unique** `migration` string (document format in ADR — e.g. `{package}:v2:{kebab_or_uuid}`). New columns **`checksum`** and **`diff_hash`** (nullable) extend the row; **`ran_at`** semantics unchanged (§6 may still call it `applied_at` in prose only).

### Q2 — Checksum algorithm and canonical serialization

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **A** | SHA-256 over UTF-8 bytes of canonical JSON. |
| **B** | BLAKE3 or truncated hash for shorter rows. |

**Ratified resolution (2026-05-02):** **A for both `checksum` and `diff_hash`.** SHA-256 is ubiquitous in PHP (`hash('sha256', …)`), tooling, and CI. **Canonical JSON rules** (ADR): UTF-8; object keys **sorted lexicographically**; arrays preserve order; integers vs floats disallowed in ambiguous forms; `null` only where schema allows. `checksum` hashes the **canonical SchemaDiff / plan intent**; `diff_hash` hashes the **canonical serialized compiled plan** (DTO list) once Phase 3 exists.

### Q3 — `MigrationPlan` vs `CompositeDiff` (empty plan)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **A** | Tagged union: `Plan \| Empty`. |
| **B** | **Single composite root:** `CompositeDiff` with **zero operations** is the canonical empty plan. |

**Ratified resolution (2026-05-02):** **B.** Avoid parallel “empty” types. **`MigrationPlan`** (readonly DTO) wraps **metadata** (`migration` ledger key, `package`, `dependencies`) plus a **root `CompositeDiff`** (possibly empty). No `up`/`down`; “no work” is `CompositeDiff([])` with deterministic JSON `{"ops":[]}`.

### Q4 — Merge algorithm (legacy `Migration` + v2 in one graph)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **A** | Always run all legacy migrations in a batch before any v2 plan. |
| **B** | **Single directed acyclic graph:** nodes = all pending units (legacy + v2); edges = `$after` / `dependencies`; topological sort; **tie-break** `(package ASC, migration ASC)`. |

**Ratified resolution (2026-05-02):** **B.** Deterministic, declarative, and avoids hidden “legacy first” coupling. If a product needs ordering across kinds, authors declare **`$after` / `dependencies`** explicitly. Document that **cross-kind edges are allowed** when safe (e.g. v2 after a legacy table-creating migration).

### Q5 — SQLite `AlterColumn` support (v1 compiler)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **A** | Attempt full SQLite table rebuild for arbitrary alters. |
| **B** | **v1: reject `AlterColumn` at compile time** for SQLite with a stable diagnostic code; additive-only path until rebuild strategy exists. |

**Ratified resolution (2026-05-02):** **B.** Keeps the compiler honest and predictable; aligns with “unsafe changes blocked or surfaced explicitly.” Broader `AlterColumn` support becomes a **later ADR** with table-rebuild semantics and tests.

### Q6 — Foreign keys on SQLite (v1 compiler)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **A** | Emit `REFERENCES` clauses where SQLite accepts them; document limitations. |
| **B** | **v1: reject `AddForeignKey` and `DropForeignKey`** at compile time for SQLite with `FOREIGN_KEY_UNSUPPORTED_SQLITE_V1`. |

**Ratified resolution (2026-05-02):** **B.** SQLite FK behavior and `ALTER TABLE` interactions are easy to get wrong; v1 focuses on **structural columns and indexes** Waaseyaa already models well. MySQL/PostgreSQL compilers (future) implement FK ops with a separate capability matrix ADR.

### Q7 — Where `EntityLevelDiff` is produced (package / layer)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **A** | New small package for diff types only. |
| **B** | **Atomic `SchemaDiff` / `CompositeDiff` value types in `waaseyaa/foundation`** (no imports from entity layers); **factory/builder that constructs entity-scoped composites in `waaseyaa/entity-storage`** using `EntityTypeInterface` + `FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface`. |

**Ratified resolution (2026-05-02):** **B.** Respects the layer graph: foundation stays free of L1+ domain imports; entity-storage already owns `SqlSchemaHandler` / table naming and can emit **pure DTO graphs** upward. **`EntityLevelDiff`** in the spec remains a **semantic wrapper** (metadata + child `CompositeDiff`), implemented as a readonly type **living next to factories** in entity-storage or as a named pattern in docs without forcing a cycle.

### Q8 — CLI surface (`--dry-run` / `--verify`)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **A** | New top-level commands only (`migrate:plan`, `schema:verify`). |
| **B** | **Extend existing `migrate`** with `--dry-run`; add **`--verify`** on `migrate` (or document pairing with `schema:check` if verify belongs there — pick one surface). |

**Ratified resolution (2026-05-02):** **B with a single verify entry point:** **`bin/waaseyaa migrate --dry-run`** compiles and prints pending legacy + v2 work without writes; **`bin/waaseyaa migrate --verify`** runs the verify pass described in §7.3 (no apply). If `schema:check` already covers overlap, **implementation** must consolidate so operators see one story (ADR); design intent is **no new command family** without ADR.

### Q9 — Deprecation calendar for string `migrations` paths

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **A** | Set a hard removal release for directory-based discovery. |
| **B** | **Keep string path indefinitely** as an escape hatch; **prefer ordered array** for new packages; deprecate only **“ordering by filename alone”** as undocumented behavior. |

**Ratified resolution (2026-05-02):** **Hybrid (B + soft Phase 6 signal):** **No hard removal date** in this spec — [#1286](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/1286) installs depend on string paths. Phase 6 adds **array** form as the **preferred** declarative manifest. **CHANGELOG + [workflow.md](./workflow.md)** announce: new work SHOULD use arrays when order matters; string path remains **supported**. A **hard removal** (if ever) requires a **future major** + ADR and is **out of scope** for Phase 1–2.
