# Revision system (unified, with an optional translation axis)

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-14 - R21 #2010 / #1968: under default-revision discipline, setPublishedRevision() now partitions the target revision snapshot through BundleSubtableGateway and upserts column-stored bundle values in the same transaction as the base-row/pointer promotion. Draft saves remain revision-only and do not leak into the served subtable. -->

**Status:** Design (2026-06-09). Supersedes the parallel two-axis storage stack
described in [`entity-storage-two-axis.md`](entity-storage-two-axis.md): that
mission (M-004) built a *separate* `vid`-based storage stack
(`RevisionableSqlBlobStorage` / `RevisionableSqlColumnStorage` /
`RevisionRowHydrator` / `RevisionableEntityStorageInterface`) that was never
wired into the kernel. This doc folds its per-language design into the single
live revision system and retires that parallel stack.

## 1. One system, an optional second axis

There is **one** revision system: `EntityRepository` + `RevisionableStorageDriver`
+ `SqlSchemaHandler`. It has two axes; the translation axis is optional.

- **Revision axis (always, when `revisionable: true`).** The base row carries a
  `revision_id` pointer (and, since alpha.195, a `published_revision_id`
  pointer). Each save snapshots the entity into `<entity>_revision`
  (single underscore), `revision_id` monotonic per entity. **Unchanged from
  today.**
- **Translation axis (only when also `translatable: true`).** The entity
  additionally keeps **per-language revision history** in a sibling table
  `<entity>__translation__revision`, with **independent per-language
  sequencing** (editing English does not bump the Anishinaabemowin revision
  count, and vice-versa).
- **Pruning/deletion immortality (FR-038, extended).** `EntityRepository::pruneRevisions()`
  and `RevisionableStorageDriver::deleteRevision()` never delete the current
  revision (`revision_id`), the published revision (`published_revision_id`),
  OR the latest revision (`getLatestRevisionId()`) — all three are excluded
  from every deletion candidate set (#1920 WP-2 rework for the current+
  published pair; #1920 PR-1 / §7e below for the latest-revision extension,
  needed once default-revision discipline can decouple the current pointer
  from the tip). Base tables predating the `published_revision_id` column
  behave exactly as before: only the current-revision guard applies, no SQL
  error.

A `revisionable`-only entity (FNPI's `page`, `identity_pillar`, `document`,
`drive_asset` today) is the **zero-translation default** and behaves exactly as
it does now.

> **Hard guardrail.** Every change for the translation axis is additive and
> gated on `EntityTypeInterface::isTranslatable()`. The single-axis code path is
> byte-for-byte unchanged (FNPI page-parity depends on it). A single-axis entity
> never gets a `<entity>__translation__revision` table.

## 2. Schema

| Table | When | Key | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<entity>` | always | `id` (+ `revision_id`, `published_revision_id` pointers) | current/tip values |
| `<entity>_revision` | `revisionable` | `(entity_id, revision_id)` | full snapshot per default-language revision (unchanged) |
| `<entity>__translation__revision` | `revisionable` **and** `translatable` | `(entity_id, langcode, revision_id)` | per-language snapshot; `revision_id` monotonic **per `(entity_id, langcode)`** |

We keep A's `revision_id` idiom on both tables (not the M-004 `vid` surrogate),
so single-axis and the translation axis read the same way and the existing
single-axis path is untouched. `<entity>__translation__revision` columns:
`entity_id`, `langcode`, `revision_id`, `revision_created`, `revision_log`,
`revision_author`, and the field values (a `_data` JSON blob for sql-blob
entities, the framework default). A composite `UNIQUE (entity_id, langcode, revision_id)`
plus an index `(entity_id, langcode, revision_id DESC)` expresses the logical
key and serves the per-language tip/list hot paths.

### 2a. Revision metadata columns (both live tables)

Every revision row on **both** live tables carries the same metadata block:

| Column | Type | Nullability | Semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| `revision_created` | varchar(32) | NOT NULL | write timestamp |
| `revision_log` | text | NULL | optional log message |
| `revision_author` | int | **NULL, no default** | acting account uid that created the revision. Soft FK — no FK constraint, no ON DELETE: revision history survives user deletion. `0` if and only if the anonymous account acted; SQL NULL = no acting context (never coerced to 0). |

`revision_author` was added by mission `revision-audit-provenance-01KTWY5V`
(FR-001/FR-003). Its name and nullable-int soft-FK definition are adopted
verbatim from the dormant `RevisionTableBuilder` dialect (see §6) so exactly
one authoritative author definition exists — the live one described here.

**Additive sync for pre-existing tables.** `ensureRevisionTable()` and
`ensureTranslationRevisionTable()` no longer pure-early-return when the table
exists: they additively add `revision_author` if missing (`fieldExists` →
`addField`, the `ensureBundleSubtable()` pattern). Idempotent; no other column
is touched and no row is rewritten. The sync runs at kernel boot / `db:init`
(both production callers — the kernel repository factory and
`EntitySchemaSync` — flow through `SqlSchemaHandler`), never per save.
Pre-existing rows keep SQL NULL and read back a `null` author with zero
migration.

**`db:init` provisions two-axis schema by default (alpha.234, mission
`wayfinding-stress-remediation-01KVGK4Q`).** `db:init` now runs `EntitySchemaSync`
**by default** (opt out with `--no-sync-schema`), so a fresh `db:init` materializes
every registered entity type's full schema — including the two-axis
`<id>_revision` and `<id>__translation__revision` tables — not just
migration-defined tables. Previously schema sync was opt-in (`--sync-schema`), so a
fresh `db:init` created none of the entity-storage tables and a two-axis type like
the saved-trail `wayfinding_trail` needed a manual `schema:sync` /
`revisions:enable wayfinding_trail` step. `schema:sync` (the same runner) was and
remains correct; only `db:init`'s default changed.

## 3. Save contract

`EntityRepository::save($entity, SaveContext $ctx)` — `SaveContext` already
carries `withLangcode()` / `withTranslations()`.

- **Single-axis (no langcode):** unchanged — one row to `<entity>_revision`,
  base pointer advanced.
- **One language (`withLangcode('oj')`)** on a two-axis entity: one row to
  `<entity>__translation__revision` for that langcode, its own `revision_id`
  sequence; the per-`(entity, langcode)` current pointer advances. Other
  languages are untouched.
- **Atomic multi-language (`withTranslations(['en' => ..., 'oj' => ...]))`:** one
  transaction, one row per langcode; all-or-nothing (rolls back as
  `PartialSaveException` on any failure).

Driver support already exists (`RevisionableStorageDriver::writeRevision(..., ?string $langcode)`
→ `writePerLangcodeRevision`); Phase 1 makes the schema, the repository wiring,
and the load side real and tested rather than dormant.

### 3b. Optimistic locking — expected-revision conflict detection (#1647)

Mission `optimistic-locking-01KTXCHY`. Canonical contract:
`kitty-specs/optimistic-locking-01KTXCHY/contracts/conflict-detection.md`. The
existing `revision_id` pointer IS the version column — no schema change, no
migration (C-001).

**Stating an expectation.** `SaveContext::default()->withExpectedRevisionId(int $n)`
states "I am updating the entity as of revision `n`". Immutable builder
(`withActorUid` shape): returns a new instance, re-threads every other field;
`n < 1` throws `InvalidArgumentException`; `withExpectedRevisionId(null)` is the
explicit no-expectation pass-through. Accessor: `expectedRevisionId(): ?int`.
With no expectation stated, **every conflict branch is skipped and the save is
byte-identical to the legacy path** — same write sequence, same events, zero
added queries (pinned by `tests/Integration/Locking/NoExpectationInvarianceTest.php`
with a counting `DatabaseInterface` decorator). Disjoint-field merge is
preserved on both the no-expectation path and the winner of an
expectation-stated race.

**Two-stage check** (active only when `expectedRevisionId() !== null`, on
revision-creating saves of single-axis revisionable types):

1. **Fail-fast pre-check** — immediately after the original-entity load that
   `doSave()` already performs (zero added queries), the expectation is
   compared against the loaded head. Mismatch, or no readable head → throw
   `RevisionConflictException` **before any write, before `preSave()`, before
   any lifecycle event** (`PRE_SAVE`/`BeforeSaveEvent` are not dispatched;
   the entity object is not mutated). Ordering: Mission 1 save-time validation
   runs FIRST — a save that is both invalid and conflicted reports
   `EntityValidationException`, not the conflict.
2. **Authoritative guarded pointer claim** (the race closure) — inside the
   write transaction, after `writeRevision()` allocates the new revision id and
   before the full base write:

   ```sql
   UPDATE <base> SET <revisionKey> = :newRevisionId
   WHERE <idKey> = :id AND <revisionKey> = :expected
   ```

   Affected rows `1` → the claim holds; the full base write proceeds in the
   **same transaction** (separating claim and write would reopen the race) and
   the save commits. `0` → a competing writer moved the head between pre-check
   and claim: the whole transaction rolls back (the freshly written revision
   row included — no orphan revisions), the current head is re-read, and
   `RevisionConflictException` is thrown carrying it. The affected-rows signal
   is **unambiguous on every backend** (SQLite, MySQL/InnoDB, Postgres):
   the SET always changes the value — the new revision id is freshly allocated
   and can never equal the expectation — so `0` always means "predicate did
   not match", never MySQL's "matched but unchanged". Of any set of concurrent
   saves stating the same expectation, **exactly one commits** (pinned by
   `tests/Integration/Locking/ConcurrentSaveConflictTest.php` via a
   deterministic event-subscriber interleave — no threads, no sleeps).

**`RevisionConflictException`** (`Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Exception\`,
`final extends \RuntimeException`, PartialSaveException house shape): promoted
readonly `entityTypeId` (string), `entityId` (string — the REAL id, not a
request locator), `expectedRevisionId` (int), `currentRevisionId` (?int),
`errorCode === 'REVISION_CONFLICT'` (canonical `$errorCode`, not `$code`).
Deterministic content — the two revision ids plus static identity, no
timestamps. **Null-current semantics:** `currentRevisionId === null` means *no
readable head exists* — the base row vanished (concurrent delete) **or** it is
a pre-backfill row carrying no revision pointer. A null head can never match a
valid expectation (≥ 1), so it always conflicts.

**Rejection matrix.** A stated expectation that cannot be honored throws
`\LogicException` with a distinct, greppable message — **never silently
ignored, never downgraded to last-write-wins**. `\LogicException` = caller
programming error (wrong path for the feature); `RevisionConflictException` =
data race (right path, lost the race). Callers may rely on the type
distinction.

| Path + stated expectation | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| New (unsaved) entity | no current revision exists to compare against |
| Non-revisionable type | no framework change marker exists (base tables carry no `changed` column; `_data` keys are not schema-guaranteed or atomically comparable) — a fake check would be a TOCTOU lie |
| Two-axis type (revisionable + translatable) | per-language tips are a separate concurrency domain; the id-keyed pointer claim is unsound across langcode peer rows |
| Non-revision-creating save (`withoutNewRevision()`, `setNewRevision(false)`, `revisionDefault: false`) | the head pointer would not move — no unambiguous claim exists (a no-change UPDATE counts 0 on MySQL); force a revision with `setNewRevision(true)` to get a checkable save |
| No `DatabaseInterface` wired | no transaction, no guard |
| Revision driver not configured (revisionable type, driver-less repository wiring) | no revision is ever written and the claim branch is unreachable — the expectation would silently degrade to the TOCTOU-unsafe pre-check alone |

`rollback()`, `setCurrentRevision()`, `setPublishedRevision()`,
`saveTranslation()`/`saveTranslationRevision(s)()`, and `saveMany()` accept no
`SaveContext` — an expectation is **unstatable** through them, so the
"silently ignored" failure mode is unreachable by construction. Any future
`SaveContext` threading through these signatures (e.g. coordinator fan-out)
MUST adopt this rejection matrix first.

**Two-axis lift path** (beside §3a): the carve-out is liftable later with a
**langcode-scoped guard** — a claim keyed on `(entity_id, langcode)` against
the per-language tip in the `saveTranslation*` paths. Until that exists,
two-axis types reject.

**Surfaces** translate, never re-implement, this contract: the `entity.update`
tool maps the conflict to a structured `revision_conflict` error and the
rejections to `revision_expectation_unsupported`
(`docs/specs/ai-integration.md`); JSON:API maps the conflict to 409
`REVISION_CONFLICT` and the rejections to 422 (`docs/specs/api-layer.md`).

### 3a. Unified two-axis write (`saveTranslation`)

Phase 1 records per-language *revisions*; it does not by itself move the peer
*base row* that holds a language's current value. `EntityRepository::saveTranslation($entityId, $langcode, array $values, ?string $log)`
closes that gap: in **one transaction** it both

1. upserts the peer `(id, langcode)` base row (the language's current value —
   blob entities ride `_data`; the label column mirrors the label field; a new
   peer row copies the shared `uuid` from the default row so the partial-unique
   UUID index, which only constrains default-langcode rows, is satisfied), and
2. writes the per-language revision (`writeRevision(..., $langcode)`).

The base row and its history therefore move together: a language is a true peer
with its own base row and its own independent `revision_id` sequence, not an
overlay on another language's row. The default-language row and any
non-translatable fields are untouched. This is the single repository entry point
for editing a translation; storage logic stays in one place (the repository),
not orchestrated across two storage APIs by the application. `loadTranslation($id, $langcode)`
reads a language's current value back from its peer base row (the driver's
`read(..., $langcode)` selects the peer row directly on a widened-PK base table).

## 4. Load contract

- `find($id)` — tip of each language (latest `revision_id` per `(entity, langcode)`),
  single-axis unchanged.
- `loadRevision($id, $revisionId, ?$langcode)` — a specific revision; `langcode`
  null = the single-axis `<entity>_revision` path (unchanged), set = the
  per-language table.
- `listRevisions($id, ?$langcode)` — newest-first; per-language when `langcode`
  is given (independent sequence), the whole single-axis history when not.
- Published pointer (`loadPublishedRevision` / `setPublishedRevision`) is
  unchanged and remains on the revision axis.

## 4a. Revision authorship (provenance)

Mission `revision-audit-provenance-01KTWY5V` (#1644). Every revision-creating
operation records the **acting account** into `revision_author`, and revision
loads finally hydrate the `RevisionMetadata` read model.

### Recording

- **Coverage:** all production revision writes flow through
  `EntityRepository` → `RevisionableStorageDriver::writeRevision(..., ?int $author)`:
  `doSave()` (immediate and deferred-id writes), `rollback()`,
  `saveTranslationRevision()` / `saveTranslationRevisions()`,
  `saveTranslation()`, and `backfillInitialRevisions()`. No path constructs a
  revision row without going through the resolution. The driver writes what it
  is given; resolution is the repository's job.
- **Resolution order** (computed once per operation, never per row):
  1. `SaveContext::withActorUid(?int)` override when set — including an
     explicit `withActorUid(null)`, which forces a NULL author inside an
     authenticated request (system-attributed maintenance writes). The
     override is a `(actorUid, actorOverridden)` pair: a context that never
     called `withActorUid()` defers to the ambient holder.
  2. The ambient request-scoped acting-account context
     (`Waaseyaa\Access\Context\AccountContextInterface`, attached to the
     repository by the kernel factory via `setAccountContext()`) —
     `current()?->id()` cast to int.
  3. `null`.
- **Null-vs-0 rule:** `0` is recorded if and only if the resolved actor IS the
  anonymous account (id 0). Absence of an acting context (CLI, queue,
  bootstrap — anywhere nothing set the context) records SQL NULL. No fallback
  or default ever coerces null to 0.
- **Revert authorship:** a revision created by `rollback()` is authored by
  whoever performed the revert, resolved at revert time. The reverted-to
  (target) revision row is never modified, and its original author never
  leaks onto the new revision (the copied row's `revision_author` is
  stripped before the write; the explicit author parameter is authoritative).
- **Immutability:** in-place revision updates
  (`SaveContext::withoutNewRevision()` → `updateRevision()`) never touch
  `revision_author` — it is immutable revision metadata, like
  `revision_created` / `revision_log`.

### Readback

`loadRevision()` and the translation-revision load paths (hence
`listRevisions()` / `listTranslationRevisions()` transitively) hydrate

```
RevisionMetadata(
    revisionCreatedAt: \DateTimeImmutable   ← revision_created
    revisionAuthor:    ?int                 ← revision_author (SQL NULL → null)
    revisionLog:       ?string              ← revision_log
)
```

and attach it via `setRevisionMetadata()` on entities implementing
`RevisionableEntityInterface` (instanceof-guarded — non-revisionable entity
classes are unaffected). `revisionMetadata()->revisionAuthor` round-trips
exactly what was recorded: `int` for an account (including `0` for
anonymous), `null` for no actor. Rows whose `revision_author` is SQL NULL —
including every row created before the column existed — hydrate
`revisionAuthor: null`; no error, no sentinel.

### Pointer-move event (`RevisionPointerMovedEvent`)

`Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Event\RevisionPointerMovedEvent` is dispatched (by
FQCN) when a revision **pointer** moves without creating a new revision:

- `setPublishedRevision()` — operation `'publish'`; `fromRevisionId` is the
  prior `published_revision_id` (null when previously unpublished).
- `setCurrentRevision()` — operation `'revert'`; `fromRevisionId` is the
  prior base `revision_id` pointer.

Payload: `entityTypeId`, `entityId`, `operation`, `fromRevisionId: ?int`,
`toRevisionId: int`, plus `actorUid: ?int` — the actor resolved at dispatch
time (same resolution and null-vs-0 semantics as above), carried so listeners
need not re-resolve. Both dispatches happen **after** the pointer transaction
commits (a rolled-back move produces no event) and ride alongside — not
replacing — the legacy `EntityEvents::REVISION_REVERTED` dispatch.
`rollback()` dispatches **no** pointer event: it creates a new revision
(authorship covered by `revision_author`) and flows through
`REVISION_CREATED`. The audit subsystem subscribes via
`PublishPointerAuditListener` (`revision.publish` / `revision.revert` kinds —
see `docs/specs/ocap-audit-log.md`).

### Pre-write choke point (`BeforeRevisionPointerMoveEvent`)

CW-v1 WP-2 task 2.4 (#1920). `RevisionPointerMovedEvent` above fires only
**after** a pointer transaction commits — too late for a subscriber to deny
the move. `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Event\BeforeRevisionPointerMoveEvent`
(extends Symfony `Event`, mirroring `WorkflowTransitionEvent`'s shape) is
dispatched (by FQCN) **before any write**, on all six revision-mutating paths
that bypass the ordinary save pipeline (and therefore WP-1's
`WorkflowStateGuard`, which only observes `EntityRepository::save()`):

- `rollback()` — operation `'rollback'`; `fromRevisionId` is the prior
  current/tip pointer, `toRevisionId` is `null` (the new revision's id is
  assigned by the write itself, not knowable yet).
- `setCurrentRevision()` — operation `'revert'`; `fromRevisionId` is the prior
  base `revision_id` pointer, `toRevisionId` is the caller-supplied target
  revision id (known up front).
- `setPublishedRevision()` — operation `'publish'`; `fromRevisionId` is the
  prior `published_revision_id` (null when previously unpublished),
  `toRevisionId` is the caller-supplied target revision id.
- `saveTranslationRevision()` / `saveTranslationRevisions()` (once per
  langcode) / `saveTranslation()` — operation `'translation_save'`;
  `fromRevisionId` is the langcode's prior latest revision id (via
  `getLatestLangcodeRevisionId()`, null for a language's first revision),
  `toRevisionId` is `null` (driver-assigned).

Payload also carries `entityTypeId`, `entityId`, `actorUid: ?int` (same
resolution/null-vs-0 semantics as above), and `revisionValues: array` — the
TARGET revision's raw values array (the existing row for `revert`/`publish`,
the freshly-loaded row being re-written for `rollback`, or the new content for
`translation_save`) — so a subscriber can read `workflow_state` without a
second load.

A subscriber denies by **throwing** `AbortOperationException` (not
`stopPropagation()` — same convention as `BeforeSaveEvent`): the exception
propagates out of the repository method before any backend write, and for the
transactional multi-write paths (`saveTranslationRevisions()`,
`saveTranslation()`) rolls back any write already attempted earlier in the
same transaction. Deliberately **not** `EntityEvents::PRE_SAVE` /
`BeforeSaveEvent`: these six call sites are pointer moves or translation-axis
writes, not `doSave()` saves, and reusing the save event name would silently
activate save-semantics listeners. Task 2.5 wires a workflow pointer-move
guard onto this event.

## 5. Access

Per-language revision access composes through
`Waaseyaa\Access\Policy\RevisionPolicyComposition` (kept): a policy may inspect
`$context['langcode']` for `view_revision` / `revert_revision` so, e.g., one
role sees English-only history and another sees both languages.

## 6. What retires

The unwired parallel `vid` stack is removed once the capability above lands and
is tested in the live system:

- `RevisionableSqlBlobStorage`, `RevisionableSqlColumnStorage` (standalone vid storages)
- `RevisionRowHydrator` (their hydrator)
- `RevisionableEntityStorageInterface` (their contract)
- `RevisionPruner` if it only served the above (else kept and pointed at A)

Kept: `SaveContext`, the typed exceptions, `RevisionPolicyComposition`, the
`make:storage-migration --add-revisions/--add-translations` generators, and
`RevisionTableBuilder`/`TranslationSchemaHandler` where still used by the
translation substrate.

### 6a. Dormant `__revision` emission dialect — explicitly retired (FR-009)

Mission `revision-audit-provenance-01KTWY5V` closes the two-dialect ambiguity
the M-004 leftovers created:

- **`RevisionTableBuilder`'s `<entity>__revision` (double-underscore) vid
  emission dialect is non-live and superseded** — including its
  `revision_created_at` / `revision_author` / `revision_log` metadata block
  and its surrogate `vid` primary key. No production code creates or reads
  those tables. Its only production reference,
  `TranslationSchemaHandler::syncTwoAxis()`, **has no production callers**
  (the kernel and `EntitySchemaSync` call `sync()` only); everything else is
  tests.
- **The single authoritative author definition is the live dialect's
  `revision_author` column** on `<entity>_revision` /
  `<entity>__translation__revision` (§2a) — the dormant dialect's column
  definition (name, nullable int, soft FK) was adopted verbatim into the live
  tables, so its author semantics now live exclusively there. The
  `RevisionMetadata` docblock references the live table/columns
  (`revision_created`, not the dormant `revision_created_at`).
- **Deletion of the dormant stack is NOT part of this retirement.** It stays
  conditioned on this section's staged plan (live two-axis capability tests
  before removal). Do not wire `syncTwoAxis()` into production to "reconcile
  by activation" — it would create second, parallel `__revision` tables
  alongside the live `_revision` ones.

## 7. Default-revision discipline (CW-v1 option-1)

Mission CW-v1 option-1 forward-draft rebuild (#1920 PR-1). Design:
`docs/history/plans/` session artifacts + the anchor issue; see
`docs/specs/content-workflow.md` "Deferred: forward drafts on the shipped
workflow" for why this exists. **Storage mechanics only** — this section
describes the mechanical primitives that shipped dormant in PR-1 (no
production caller set the flags yet). **#1920 PR-2 wires them live** —
`WorkflowStateGuard` now sets the entity flag on every guarded save and
`WorkflowPointerMoveGuard` now sets the event flag for `publish`/`rollback`
(plus a same-state republish two-step and a `revert`-denial addition of its
own); see `docs/specs/content-workflow.md` "Default-revision discipline
(CW-v1 option-1, #1920 PR-2 — as-built)" for the workflows-layer half — this
section remains the storage-layer contract and is otherwise unchanged by
PR-2 (no storage-mechanics edit was needed to wire the flags).

### 7a. The keystone: discipline is a workflow-layer signal, honored mechanically

A naive storage rule ("published pointer present → revision-only saves")
would break every install that carries a pointered-but-unbound row (Playbook
H steps 1–4 without binding): their ordinary edits would silently stop
reaching the base row. Storage (L1) also cannot ask "is this bound?" —
bindings are L3 (`waaseyaa/workflows`). Therefore **the workflows layer
decides when discipline applies; storage only supplies the mechanics** —
two transient flags, honored mechanically wherever they are found:

- **Entity flag** — `Waaseyaa\Entity\RevisionableEntityTrait::$defaultRevisionDiscipline`
  (private bool, default `false`), with `setDefaultRevisionDiscipline(bool): void`
  and `isDefaultRevisionDisciplined(): bool`. Transient — never persisted,
  like the trait's existing `$newRevision`. Set as an **unconditional
  boolean on every guarded save** (never set-on-true only) by
  `WorkflowStateGuard` (wired #1920 PR-2), so a stale `true` from a prior
  save of a long-lived entity object can never leak into a later, unguarded
  save.
- **Event flag** — `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Event\BeforeRevisionPointerMoveEvent::$defaultRevisionSemantics`
  (private bool, default `false`), with `applyDefaultRevisionSemantics(): void`
  and `defaultRevisionSemantics(): bool`. Set by a binding-aware subscriber
  (`WorkflowPointerMoveGuard`, wired #1920 PR-2) on the pre-write choke point
  (§4 "Pre-write choke point") for the specific pointer operation in flight.
- **No workflows package / no binding / no pointer ⇒ byte-identical
  behavior to today.** This is the hard regression gate, verified by a
  Playbook-H-shaped test: a pointered-but-unbound entity's ordinary save,
  `setPublishedRevision()`, and `rollback()` all produce IDENTICAL writes to
  before this section existed.

Both flags are duck-checked (`method_exists`) at their consumption sites,
mirroring the `#1654` `method_exists(getRevisionId())` pattern — an entity
carrying revision capability via `RevisionableEntityInterface` +
`RevisionableEntityTrait` without declaring the legacy `RevisionableInterface`
still gets the flag read correctly.

### 7b. Revision-only saves (`EntityRepository::doSave()`)

Evaluated immediately after the `PRE_SAVE` dispatch (that is where the
guard sets the entity flag) and only when a revision driver exists, the
entity type is revisionable, and the entity is not new:

- **Stated `expectedRevisionId` on a disciplined save** — new rejection-matrix
  row (§3b above): `\LogicException`, thrown before any write. The guarded
  optimistic-locking claim is a base-pointer UPDATE, structurally meaningless
  when the base pointer must not move under discipline.
- **Disciplined + revision-creating** (`shouldCreateRevision()` true):
  `writeRevision()` writes the new revision row exactly as today, and the
  new revision id is set on the in-memory entity. The base-row write is
  skipped entirely: no `$values['revision_id']` advance, no base
  `driver->write()`, no bundle-subtable upsert (subtable columns are
  per-entity — writing them would leak draft values into query joins; the
  revision row already snapshots the full pre-partition value bag). All
  events (`PRE_SAVE`/`POST_SAVE`, `REVISION_CREATED`, `BeforeSaveEvent`/
  `AfterSaveEvent`) dispatch exactly as today.
- **Disciplined + non-revision-creating (in-place)**: `updateRevision()` runs
  exactly as today. The base row is written (full `driver->write()` +
  subtable upsert) **iff** the revision being updated equals the base row's
  live `published_revision_id`, read from the already-loaded
  `$originalEntity` (zero extra queries), compared as ints; no base write
  when the pointer is unset/null. This is what lets a promote-flow's
  post-promotion status-flip save, and a sanctioned in-place edit of the
  published revision, reach the base row — while an in-place edit of a
  diverged (non-published) tip stays revision-only.
- **Consequence**: for a disciplined entity the base `revision_id` stops
  tracking the tip and stays equal to `published_revision_id`; the tip is
  `getLatestRevisionId()`.
- **Undisciplined**: byte-identical to today — including for entities that
  carry a live `published_revision_id` pointer but were never flagged (the
  Playbook-H shape). This is the hard regression gate (§7a).

### 7c. Promotion becomes a complete primitive (`setPublishedRevision()`)

The pre-write `BeforeRevisionPointerMoveEvent` dispatch is unchanged in
position; a subscriber may call `applyDefaultRevisionSemantics()` on it.
When the event reports `defaultRevisionSemantics() === true`, in the SAME
transaction as the pointer move: the base row is overwritten from the
TARGET revision's full values (content, `workflow_state`, and the
revision's own stored `status`) — bookkeeping keys stripped exactly like
`rollback()` strips them (`revision_id`, `revision_created`, `revision_log`,
`revision_author`, `entity_id`), id preserved — and BOTH `revision_id` and
`published_revision_id` are set to the target. The target revision row
itself is never mutated. Without the flag: today's targeted single-column
`UPDATE published_revision_id = …`, byte-identical (`EntityRepositoryPublishedRevisionTest`
stays green, untouched). Post-commit events (`REVISION_REVERTED`,
`RevisionPointerMovedEvent`) are unchanged either way.

### 7d. Content-restore under discipline (`rollback()`)

When the pre-write event's `defaultRevisionSemantics()` is true: the
outgoing row is prepared exactly as today (bookkeeping stripped,
`published_revision_id`/`status` restored from the live base row so the
target revision's frozen snapshot never leaks those two columns), but ONLY
the new revision row is written — no base `driver->write()`, no base
repoint. Restoring old content into the working copy is a draft operation;
it goes live via the normal promotion path (§7c). Unflagged: unchanged
(the base row is still repointed and rewritten, exactly as documented in
"Fixed (final-review fix wave)" in `content-workflow.md`).

`setCurrentRevision()` gets no storage change in PR-1: the next PR's guard
denies it outright under discipline, before any write (its only effect — a
bare base-row repoint+rewrite — has no coherent meaning once the base row
belongs exclusively to the published pointer).

### 7e. Pruning/deletion immortality: the working copy joins the pointers

`EntityRepository::pruneRevisions()` and `RevisionableStorageDriver::deleteRevision()`
now additionally exclude the **latest** revision (`getLatestRevisionId()`)
from every deletion candidate set, alongside the pre-existing current
(`revision_id`) and published (`published_revision_id`) pointer exclusions
(§1's immortality bullet, updated). Under discipline the base `revision_id`
pointer stops tracking the tip (§7b), so the current-revision guard alone no
longer protects the working copy — without this extension, a prune during a
review window could destroy an in-progress draft. For an undisciplined
entity the latest revision is normally also the current revision, so the
guard is usually redundant — with one real (and deliberate) behavior change:
after a `setCurrentRevision()` revert (reachable in production via the
`entity.set_current_revision` MCP/AI tool), the abandoned newer tip is the
latest-but-not-current revision, and it is now un-prunable by keep-last-N
and un-deletable where it previously was not. Conservative by design: the
rule is uniform rather than flag-conditional, and it retains data rather
than risking a working copy.

### 7f. Working-copy load (`loadWorkingCopy()`)

`EntityRepositoryInterface::loadWorkingCopy(string $id): ?EntityInterface`
(and the `EntityRepository` implementation): when a revision driver exists
and `getLatestRevisionId($id)` is strictly newer than the base row's
`revision_id` pointer, returns `loadRevision($id, $latest)`; otherwise
returns exactly what `find($id)` returns. For every undisciplined entity the
latest revision always equals the base pointer, so
`loadWorkingCopy() === find()` there — mechanically safe to call on any
revisionable (or non-revisionable, or driver-less) entity without first
knowing whether it is bound to a workflow. Every in-repo implementor of
`EntityRepositoryInterface` (including test doubles) gained this method in
the same change so the interface addition does not break any consumer.

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-13 - CW-v1 option-1 forward-draft rebuild, #1920 PR-1: added §7 "Default-revision discipline (CW-v1 option-1)" — the entity + event transient discipline flags, revision-only saves in doSave(), setPublishedRevision() as a complete promotion primitive, rollback() gone revision-only under discipline, the latest-revision immortality extension to pruning/deletion, and loadWorkingCopy(). All dormant in PR-1 (storage mechanics only; the workflows engine wires the flags in the next PR). Undisciplined behavior is byte-identical to before this section, including for pointered-but-unbound (Playbook-H-shaped) entities. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-13 - CW-v1 option-1 forward-draft rebuild, #1920 PR-2: §7's flags are no longer dormant — WorkflowStateGuard/WorkflowPointerMoveGuard wire them live (removed "forthcoming" wording); cross-referenced docs/specs/content-workflow.md's new "Default-revision discipline (CW-v1 option-1, #1920 PR-2 — as-built)" section for the workflows-layer half (guard wiring, same-state republish, working-copy basis, revert denial, read-side re-sourcing). No storage-mechanics change in this file was needed for PR-2 — the primitives PR-1 shipped were already complete. -->

## 8. Acceptance

- Framework suite green; the existing single-axis revision tests pass
  **unchanged** (byte-for-byte regression gate).
- A new two-axis E2E proves independent per-language sequencing (the M-004
  FR-043 timeline: create en → add oj → edit en ×3 → edit oj ×2 ⇒ en at
  revision 4, oj at revision 3).
- FNPI full suite + page-parity green after the framework pin bump.

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-12 - mission optimistic-locking-01KTXCHY WP03 (#1647): added §3b optimistic locking — SaveContext::withExpectedRevisionId() expectation seam, two-stage check (fail-fast pre-check before any write/event + guarded pointer-claim UPDATE inside the save transaction, affected-rows unambiguous because the pointer always moves), RevisionConflictException payload with null-current = "no readable head (row vanished or pre-backfill pointer-less row)", the six-row LogicException rejection matrix (new / non-revisionable / two-axis / non-revision-creating / no-DB / no-revision-driver), context-less paths unstatable by construction, two-axis langcode-scoped-guard lift path beside §3a. No-expectation saves byte-identical (zero added queries, pinned). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-12 - mission revision-audit-provenance-01KTWY5V WP05: added §2a (revision_author column + additive sync on both live revision tables), §4a (authorship recording/resolution order/null-vs-0/revert authorship, RevisionMetadata hydration on loads, RevisionPointerMovedEvent), §6a (explicit FR-009 retirement of the dormant RevisionTableBuilder `<entity>__revision` vid dialect incl. its revision_created_at metadata block; live revision_author is the single authoritative author definition). Refs #1644, #1645. -->
