# Classification & Retention Engine

Mission: `classification-retention-engine-01KSEFTH`. Refs: gap-matrix-A4, DIR-004.

The classification substrate lets a Nation label any entity with a
confidentiality/hold classification, inherit labels down a parent chain,
gate access by clearance, and drive retention (purge / redact / hold) from
those labels. It lives entirely in `packages/field` (L1) plus a thin set of
JSON:API routes in `packages/foundation` (L4 route registrar) and an admin
SPA editor in `packages/admin` (L6).

## Layers & ownership

## Labels

Nine bundled seed labels (override/extend via `config:import`) in
`packages/field/defaults/classification-labels.yaml`, keyed by `label_id`
with an ordinal `confidentiality_level` (0 = public … 80 = hold-ethics-review):
`public`, `internal`, `confidential`, `restricted`, `nation-confidential`,
`nation-sacred`, `hold-legal`, `hold-research`, `hold-ethics-review`.

Labels prefixed `hold-` carry hold semantics (see Access). Labels are data,
not code constants — a Nation defines its own.

## Inheritance

On every save, `EntityLifecycleSubscriber` resolves the effective label via
`LabelInheritanceResolver`: an explicit `classification_label` wins; otherwise
the entity's parent (resolved per-type via `ClassificationParentResolverInterface`)
supplies the label and `classification_inherited_from = parent_uuid` is recorded.
Cascade is re-evaluate-on-next-write (no eager downward cascade — bounded scope,
C-003). Every effective-label change writes a `classification.change` audit event.

> **Wiring note (fixed in WP4, audit-remediation batch 2026-07-01/02):**
> `FieldServiceProvider::boot()` resolved the event dispatcher under the
> foundation `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Event\EventDispatcherInterface` FQCN, which
> the production kernel-services bus (`ProviderRegistryKernelServices::get()`)
> never serves — only `Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface`
> is served. `resolveOptional()` therefore returned null and
> `EntityLifecycleSubscriber` never actually registered in a real kernel boot,
> so the "on every save" behavior described above was **not happening** for
> any deployed application until this fix (same bug class as #1852). `boot()`
> now resolves the served key; see `FieldServiceProviderClassificationWiringTest`
> for the production-mirroring wiring test.

## Access (`ClassificationFieldAccessPolicy`)

Registered cross-cutting via `#[PolicyAttribute(entityType: '*')]` (the kernel
policy resolver injects the manifest entity types into the constructor; the
policy matches `'*'` in `appliesTo()`). Implements both `AccessPolicyInterface`
and `FieldAccessPolicyInterface`. Two rules, **in order**:

1. **Hold override (C-004 / FR-013).** A `hold-*` label forbids access for any
   account lacking the `legal-hold-bypass` permission — even an admin. Hold
   short-circuits: clearance is not consulted. Held data is **never** deleted or
   redacted; it stays present and is blocked at read time, preserving
   legal/research/ethics traceability.
2. **Clearance gate (FR-005 / FR-008).** Account clearance below the label's
   confidentiality level → forbidden. Otherwise neutral (other policies decide).

Open-by-default on field-level, deny-unless-granted on entity-level — the policy
only ever returns Forbidden or Neutral. An unknown label is Neutral (a
misconfigured policy never silently locks everyone out).

### Clearance

`RoleBasedClearanceChecker` maps roles → level via the `classification.role_clearance`
config (default `admin:10, nation-steward:9, editor:5, viewer:1, anonymous:0`);
the max across an account's roles wins. Nations override via config.

### Roles & permission

No central role-catalogue table exists; roles are plain strings on accounts.
`Permissions::LEGAL_HOLD_BYPASS` (`legal-hold-bypass`) is the sole hold escape
hatch — the bundled `admin` role does **not** carry it. `governance-viewer` is
the read-only role for the policy API. Both documented in
`packages/field/defaults/classification.yaml`.

## Retention rules (`RetentionPolicy`)

Columns: `name`, `applies_to` (JSON array of `label_id` patterns, glob-aware
e.g. `nation-*`), `action` (`purge` | `redact` | `hold-flag`), `trigger_kind`
(`age_based` | `event_based`), `trigger_value` (ISO-8601 duration or event-kind),
`exemptions` (JSON array of `entity_type:uuid`). Sibling of `AuditRetentionPolicy`
(audit-log retention) — split deliberately.

All retention-rule values are Protected governance configuration. Exact V2
entity and field policies permit reads to `governance-viewer` and administrator
principals and mutations only to administrators. Scheduled jobs do not acquire
an ambient user principal: they consume a closed, fixed-shape
`RetentionPolicyMaintenanceView` containing only the seven rule values.

### Scheduled jobs

`ClassificationRetentionScheduleEntries` registers three tasks (auto-discovered):

| Task | Cron | Job | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| `classification.retention.purge` | `0 */6 * * *` | `PurgeJob` | Deletes age-eligible matching entities via storage (fires `entity.delete` audit) + a `retention.purge` event each. |
| `classification.retention.redact` | `30 */6 * * *` | `RedactJob` | Nulls `#[FieldTemplate(pii: true)]` fields, preserves identity/label/audit; writes `retention.redact`. |
| `classification.retention.hold_scan` | `0 3 * * *` | `HoldScanJob` | Verification-only: flags hold-vs-purge conflicts with a `classification.change` (`conflict: hold_vs_purge`) event + notice log. Never deletes. |

All jobs are best-effort per policy iteration (NFR-004): a single failing policy
never aborts the sweep. System sweeps query with `accessCheck(false)`.

**Scan scale (L1-field.md M1).** The retention sweeps run on a cron over the whole
site, so they must not load every labelled row into memory. Two parts:

1. **Index.** The `classification_label` column is indexed (migration
   `2026_05_25_000005_index_classification_label`, which adds `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`
   on every table that has the column — additive, idempotent; it covers tables present
   when it runs, not entity tables created later by runtime schema sync).

2. **Bounded keyset scan (`RetentionScanner`).** All three jobs iterate candidates
   through `Classification\Job\RetentionScanner`, which pages by **ascending id with
   `id > lastId`** (keyset, not offset — robust under `PurgeJob`'s in-loop deletes, which
   would make offset paging skip rows) and never hydrates more than `batchSize` (default
   500) rows per round-trip. The scanner pushes the age cutoff (`created_at <`) and, when
   a policy reduces to a **single** `applies_to` pattern, the label predicate into SQL — a
   literal → `=`, a `prefix*` glob → `STARTS_WITH`; a bare `*`, empty prefix, or multiple
   patterns keep `exists('classification_label')` with no label narrowing. The SQL pushdown
   is only a *sound narrowing*: each job's `matchesLabel()` / hold-`*` guard / exemption /
   PII-discovery logic is unchanged and does the exact matching, so behaviour is identical
   to the prior unbounded `loadMultiple()` — only peak memory is now O(batch), not
   O(all-labelled-rows). `HoldScanJob` uses no label narrowing (a hold-vs-purge conflict
   needs ANY hold match AND ANY purge match, which is not one AND-able predicate).

## JSON:API + admin

`/api/classification/policies[/{id}]` — index/show gate `governance-viewer,admin`;
store/update/destroy gate `admin`. Served by the standard `JsonApiController`
(friendly aliases over the auto-generated `/api/retention_policy` routes). The
admin SPA editor (`/classification/policies`) lists policies via
`useRetentionPolicies` and edits them with `SchemaForm` against the
`retention_policy` JSON-Schema. Nav entry under "Governance".

## Tests

- Unit: field package `tests/Unit/Classification/**`, `tests/Unit/Entity/RetentionPolicyTest.php`.
- Integration: `tests/Integration/PhaseClassificationRetention/ClassificationRetentionIntegrationTest.php` (FR-015) — composes inheritance + access end-to-end; the hold-block assertion is the C-004/FR-013 guard (removing the policy registration must fail it).
- Admin: `packages/admin/tests/unit/composables/useRetentionPolicies.test.ts` + `e2e/classification-policies.spec.ts` (deferred run).
