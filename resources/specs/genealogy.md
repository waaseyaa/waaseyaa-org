# Genealogy package (v0.1)

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-06 - genealogy m-a (security): the living-person concealment covered only genealogy_person of the 4 content types. GenealogyContentAccessPolicy's living guard was gated behind getEntityTypeId() === 'genealogy_person' on both the anonymous path (anonymousPublishedViewAccess()) and the authenticated-non-owner path (viewAccess()), so genealogy_family and genealogy_event -- both carrying a REQUIRED free-text display_name that in practice names living people, family being anonymously SSR-viewable via family() and both crawler-enumerable -- fell through to allowed() on published-entity + published-tree alone. Fixed with a new concealsForLivingPrivacy() the guards both call: genealogy_person keeps the effectiveIsLiving() rule; genealogy_family/genealogy_event fail CLOSED (their free-text display_name has no living/deceased axis to test per row), refused to non-owners/anonymous even when published; tree owners and DevAdminAccount keep access (local demo unaffected). Added both to SeoPublicController::NON_PUBLIC_TYPES as an independent crawler-surface gate (the access-aware enumeration already drops them now anon view is Forbidden -- defense in depth). Folded-in residual m2: GenealogyPedigreeService::neighborSlots() redacted-slot placeholder unified from 'Private living relative'/'Private ancestor' to a single 'Private relative' (REDACTED_RELATIVE_LABEL) so a redacted slot no longer leaks the concealed relative's living/deceased status; residual m2a (the preserved COUNT of redacted slots) is intrinsic to the redacted-placeholder chart design and left as-is. genealogy_tree assessed and unaffected (workspace label, gated by treeView()). Pinned by GenealogyFamilyEventConcealmentTest, GenealogySeoEnumerationTest::sitemap_and_llms_never_enumerate_genealogy_family_or_event, and updated GenealogySsrConcealmentTest. See "Access policies" and "Domain services" below and CHANGELOG "Security". -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-05 - audit-remediation batch R8 WP3 (defense-in-depth, completes the R7 WP1 label channel here too): GenealogyPedigreeService.php:150,192 (neighborSlots()/ancestorGenerationsRedacted()) previously read $person->label()/$subject->label() directly once the entity-level `$gate->allows('view', ...)` check passed, bypassing label-field-access the way the three sites R7 WP1 fixed (SSR <title>, schema.org, Markdown H1) did. Not live exploitable pre-fix — GenealogyContentAccessPolicy::fieldAccess() always returns Neutral, so there was no entity-viewable-but-label-forbidden split to exploit — but the same landmine shape. Fixed by threading an optional EntityAccessHandler into GenealogyPedigreeService's constructor (wired via GenealogyServiceProvider's kernel-services resolve(), same pattern SearchServiceProvider/OidcServiceProvider use) and swapping both label reads for EntityAccessHandler::viewableLabel(); a Forbidden (or unwired-handler) result now falls back to the SAME redacted-placeholder shape a fully-concealed neighbor/subject already uses ("Private living relative" / "Private ancestor" / "Private profile") rather than the raw label. See "Domain services" § below and CHANGELOG "Security". -->

Greenfield genealogy modeling for Waaseyaa, inspired by public feature areas of HuMo-genealogy (person/family views, charts, relationships) without schema or code migration from HuMo.

## Entity types

| ID | Label | Purpose |
|----|-------|---------|
| `genealogy_tree` | Tree | Tenancy root: owner account, grants anchor, workspace |
| `genealogy_person` | Person | Individual in a tree |
| `genealogy_family` | Family | Household / family group |
| `genealogy_event` | Event | Vital or narrative event (birth, marriage, etc.) |

Content rows default to **unpublished** (`status` off). **`tree_id`** links persons/families/events to a **`genealogy_tree`**. Persons carry **`is_living`** (boolean; conservative default) and optional **`deleted_at`** tombstones for soft-delete.

## Relationship types (`relationship` entity)

Edges use the shared `relationship` entity type. `relationship_type` (bundle) values owned by this package:

| `relationship_type` | Directionality | From | To | Meaning |
|---------------------|----------------|------|-----|---------|
| `genealogy_parent_of` | directed | `genealogy_person` (parent) | `genealogy_person` (child) | Lineage |
| `genealogy_spouse_of` | bidirectional | `genealogy_person` | `genealogy_person` | Marriage / partnership |
| `genealogy_member_of_family` | directed | `genealogy_person` | `genealogy_family` | Household membership |
| `genealogy_identity_of_user` | directed | `user` | `genealogy_person` | “This account is this person” (B2); precedence vs grants: `docs/specs/genealogy-policy-precedence.md` |

Edges participate in traversal only when endpoint entities are **viewable** under the same access rules as direct loads.

## Access

- **Content:** `GenealogyContentAccessPolicy` enforces **private-by-default**, **`WorkflowVisibility`/`status` normalization**, **tree ownership**, **living-person concealment** for non-owners, and **tombstones**. Anonymous visitors are denied `view` on genealogy content. **Living-person concealment (`concealsForLivingPrivacy()`, genealogy m-a)** decides, per content type, whether a row's identity channel must be hidden from a non-owner / anonymous viewer even after the published-entity + published-tree gates pass: **`genealogy_person`** is concealed iff **`is_living`** (via `GenealogyLivingSemantics::effectiveIsLiving()`); **`genealogy_family`** and **`genealogy_event`** are **always** concealed for non-owners, because their REQUIRED free-text **`display_name`** names living people and has no living/deceased axis to test per row (fail closed); **`genealogy_tree`** is unaffected (workspace label, gated earlier by `treeView()`). Tree owners and the built-in **`DevAdminAccount`** bypass concealment. Family/event are also in `SeoPublicController::NON_PUBLIC_TYPES` so the crawler surface excludes them independently.
- **Graph edges:** `GenealogyRelationshipAccessPolicy` (registered at HTTP kernel boot) denies `view` when either endpoint entity fails `view`. Generic `RelationshipAccessPolicy` still applies for non-genealogy types.

## JSON:API

Standard auto-routes apply (`JsonApiRouteProvider`):

- `GET /api/genealogy_person`, `GET /api/genealogy_person/{id}` (and parallel for `genealogy_family`, `genealogy_event`, `genealogy_tree`, `relationship`).

Writes (`POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) require authentication per global JSON:API route rules.

## Public SSR (read-only)

Registered before the catch-all render routes:

| Route | Controller | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `GET /genealogy/person/{id}` | `GenealogySsrController::person` | Profile |
| `GET /genealogy/family/{id}` | `GenealogySsrController::family` | Members list |
| `GET /genealogy/person/{id}/ancestors` | `GenealogySsrController::ancestorChart` | Text ancestor levels |

Templates live in `packages/genealogy/templates/` (`*.html.twig`).

## Domain services

- `GenealogyPedigreeService` — parents, children, spouses, ordered ancestor generations (deterministic ordering by numeric id tie-break). Its public-SSR-facing `neighborSlots()`/`ancestorGenerationsRedacted()` label emission is gated at BOTH the entity level (`$gate->allows('view', ...)`) and the label-field level (`EntityAccessHandler::viewableLabel()`, R8 WP3, defense-in-depth) — a person entity-viewable but with a field-access-Forbidden label field (or with no access handler wired) renders the same redacted placeholder a fully-concealed neighbor uses, never the raw label.
- `GenealogyFamilyService` — members of a family via `genealogy_member_of_family`.
