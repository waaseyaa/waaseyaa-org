# App controller invocation (SSR `Class::method`)

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-27 - #2544: `EntityRenderer::ALWAYS_INTERNAL_FIELDS` gains `legacy_pass`, so an imported credential pending upgrade never reaches an SSR-rendered page - same treatment as `pass`. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-27 - #2624: AppControllerRouter receives the
boot-resolved RuntimePolicy debug decision from SsrServiceProvider. Exception
mapping never rereads APP_DEBUG, so post-bootstrap process mutation cannot
change whether controller failure details are disclosed. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-26 - #2569: SsrServiceProvider now supplies SsrPageHandler with the binding-aware EditorialVisibilityResolver used by ordinary entity rendering. This changes workflow publication resolution only; app-controller discovery, constructor/method argument resolution, invocation, and error mapping are unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-22 - #2501: SeoPublicController's constructor gains four optional trailing parameters (PublicUrlPolicyInterface, CrawlEligibilityPolicyInterface, SitemapContributorInterface, DiscoveryFailurePolicy). They are supplied by the EXISTING constructor-injection path in SsrPageHandler::resolveControllerInstance(), which already falls back to the HttpServiceResolverInterface for any non-builtin typed parameter and then to the declared default; no new injection channel, allowlist entry, or descriptor-cache input is introduced, and the resolution order is unchanged. Because all four are nullable with defaults, a controller instantiated where nothing is bound resolves them to null exactly as it does CanonicalPublicOrigin today, so existing consumers and the strict-mode contract are unaffected. The action methods (robotsTxt/sitemapXml/llmsTxt) still take no arguments, so no request-derived value can reach the canonical origin or a URL policy. Under DiscoveryFailurePolicy::Propagate an application policy's Throwable now leaves the controller rather than being absorbed; it is handled by the same controller-exception mapping documented under "Error -> HTTP" and introduces no new status semantics. App-controller discovery, argument resolution, and error behavior are otherwise unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-20 - #2151: SeoPublicController constructor gains an optional trailing CanonicalPublicOrigin (trusted config / APP_URL only). robotsTxt() still takes no request arguments, so Host / Forwarded / X-Forwarded-Host cannot select the Sitemap origin. App-controller discovery, argument resolution, invocation, and error behavior are unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-16 - #2113: SsrServiceProvider threads the boot-scoped InternalFieldVisibilityPolicy into SsrPageHandler's Markdown ResourceSerializer. This only unifies field projection metadata with Admin/JSON:API; application-controller discovery, argument resolution, invocation, and error behavior are unchanged. -->


<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-07 - #2291: app controllers gain an opt-in,
request-scoped redirect surface. Plain controllers may inject
Waaseyaa\Routing\Redirector; controllers that prefer Drupal-style ergonomics
may extend the thin Waaseyaa\Routing\Controller base. Named redirects use the
same WaaseyaaRouter instance that matched the request. Direct targets are
local absolute paths validated by Waaseyaa\Access\RedirectValidator. -->

## SEO metadata migration

The three framework SEO endpoints now use admitted immutable class-handler IDs
and a nonshared explicit `SeoPublicController` binding. Canonical HTTP resolves
these through the matched-handler resolver after middleware, without the generic
reflective constructor path. The factory supplies the existing trusted-origin,
anonymous field-scope/principal and discovery-policy dependencies; absence is
nullable and selected dependency faults propagate. The crawler actions still
accept no request-derived arguments. Bare legacy route callers receive the old
`Class::method` values projected from the same definitions; their app-controller
path can use the new explicit binding. Generic application argument resolution
and strict-mode behavior remain governed below. Installed cohort qualification
is pending.

## Scope

SSR app controllers are invoked through `Waaseyaa\SSR\SsrPageHandler::dispatchAppController` after a Symfony `Route` match. This spec defines **typed method arguments** only: the legacy four-argument `($params, $query, $account, $httpRequest)` contract is removed.

## Strict mode

- Configuration: `config['app_controller']['strict']` or `WAASEYAA_APP_CONTROLLER_STRICT` env. Default **strict ON** (treat unset / non-`false` as strict).
- In strict mode:
  - No implicit raw route/query bags; use `#[MapRoute]` / `#[MapQuery]` on `array` parameters when needed.
  - Content entity parameters require `#[ContentEntityType]` on the entity class (see `waaseyaa/entity`).
  - Ambiguous parameter bindings fail at **descriptor build** time (before invoke).

## Service injection (allowlist)

Method parameters resolved as services **only** for these types (or subtypes where `is_a` applies):

- `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request`
- `Waaseyaa\Access\AccountInterface`
- `Waaseyaa\Entity\EntityTypeManagerInterface` and `Waaseyaa\Entity\EntityTypeManager`
- `Twig\Environment`
- `Waaseyaa\Access\Gate\GateInterface` when the kernel supplies a gate

Additionally, the existing HTTP **service resolver** closure may satisfy a parameter by **exact interface/class name** (same rules as controller constructor resolution). Duplicate identical service types in one method signature are invalid in strict mode.

`Waaseyaa\Routing\Redirector` is also a built-in request service. The HTTP
kernel constructs it from the fully registered `WaaseyaaRouter` that matched
the request, then app-controller constructor and method-argument resolution
both expose that same instance. It is never resolved while providers register
routes and is never retained across requests.

## Redirect responses

`Waaseyaa\Routing\Redirector` is the composition-first API:

- `to(string $path, int $status = 302, array $headers = [])` returns a
  `Waaseyaa\Routing\RedirectResponse` only for a safe local absolute path.
  The response is transport-compatible with Symfony while keeping app
  signatures on Waaseyaa's public surface. Empty, scheme-bearing,
  protocol-relative, backslash-containing, and ASCII-control-containing
  targets throw `InvalidArgumentException`; they are never silently replaced
  by a fallback.
- `toRoute(string $name, array $parameters = [], int $status = 302,
  array $headers = [])` generates the target through the request's registered
  `WaaseyaaRouter`, preserving its missing-route, missing-parameter, and
  parameter-validation exceptions, then applies the same local-target check.

Applications that prefer a Drupal-style controller surface may extend the
optional `Waaseyaa\Routing\Controller`, whose protected `redirect()` and
`redirectToRoute()` methods delegate to its injected `Redirector`. The base
owns no container and exposes no entity-manager, account, configuration,
translation, rendering, or service-locator shortcuts. Plain and `final`
controllers remain first-class and inject `Redirector` directly, including as
an action parameter.

There is deliberately no global helper, trait with hidden mutable state, or
external-URL redirect convenience. External destinations require a separate
explicit trust/allowlist contract.

## Route-derived values

- `#[FromRoute('name')]` binds from the matched route attribute `name`.
- Without `#[FromRoute]`, the route attribute key defaults to the **parameter name** (e.g. `$todo` → `todo`), with camelCase → snake_case as an additional candidate.
- Scalars: invalid cast → **400** (`InvalidAppControllerArgumentException`).
- Entities: accept the entity already upcast by `HttpKernel`'s `EntityParamConverter`, or load a raw id through `EntityTypeManagerInterface::getRepository($entityTypeId)->find($rawId)` for direct invoker callers. Binding then requires the invocation context's `GateInterface` to allow `view` for the request account. A missing entity, denied view, or missing gate all collapse to the same **404** (`Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\ResourceNotFoundException`), so typed parameter injection cannot become an existence oracle or bypass entity access.
- Route option `parameters.{name}.type = entity:{entityTypeId}` declares an entity segment. Optional `_waaseyaa_app_bindings.{name}` stores an expected PHP `class-string` for validation after load.

## Error → HTTP

| Condition | Exception | HTTP |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Entity not found for id | `ResourceNotFoundException` | 404 |
| Entity view denied / gate unavailable | `ResourceNotFoundException` | 404 |
| Invalid scalar / enum | `InvalidAppControllerArgumentException` | 400 |
| Type / binding programmer error | `InvalidAppControllerBindingException` / `AppControllerTypeMismatchException` | 500 |

Response shape follows existing conventions: JSON:API errors for non-`_render` routes; HTML error page when `_render` is true (align with authorization middleware split).

## Descriptor cache key

Cached reflection metadata **must** include:

- Controller class + method name
- Route name (`_route`) when present
- Fingerprint of route data affecting binding: path, methods, `options['parameters']`, `options['_waaseyaa_app_bindings']`, and defaults that supply parameter names

See `Waaseyaa\Routing\RouteFingerprint`.

## Extension

`Waaseyaa\SSR\Http\AppController\AppControllerArgumentResolver`: optional plugins run **after** built-in resolution fails to produce a value for a parameter (see interface docblocks).

## Auth/OIDC metadata adoption

Auth/OIDC metadata handlers now follow the same explicit terminal resolver path. Stable class handler IDs remain scalar through matching and middleware, then resolve to the real public __invoke method. Auth factories preserve composed extensions, canonical eligibility, atomic limiters, password upgrades and internal readers. OIDC uses its existing owner bindings and lifetimes. Optional presence admits declarations, not successful execution; selected failures return the existing handler-unavailable refusal. No generic reflective invocation policy is changed.
