# Governed Gates: Preflight, Refresh, and Recorded-Artifact Identity

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-09-05 - #2641: bin/check-stale-spec-deferrals is a
nightly warn-only scan of live spec deferrals to closed issues. It must not
enter tools/preflight-gates.json: issue state changes elsewhere, and
resolution needs network or an injected snapshot. -->

## Why this spec exists

PR #2399 surfaced the failure shape this spec eliminates: two stale recorded rosters and one stale
spec appeared as **five red CI jobs** (the same failures repeated across `ci/unit-tests`,
`ci/random-order`, `ci/coverage`, `support/s1-contract`, and `spec-drift`), the repair commands had
to be discovered by reading verifier sources, and the local run matrix (`--testsuite Unit` +
`--testsuite Integration`) never executed the Architecture suite that CI runs. The structural
causes: no single local preflight, no single refresh command, heterogeneous state semantics
(worktree scanners vs committed-ref diffs), an advisory-local/blocking-CI split for spec drift, no
fast CI job gating the long test jobs, and roster entries whose identity binds line numbers and
whole-file hashes.

## The contract

### Hosted execution profiles

`ci.yml` exposes two event-selected profiles. An ordinary push to `main` runs
the bounded global and static controls and publishes `ci/main-feedback`.
Pull-request runs and explicit dispatches run the complete graph and publish
`ci/full-qualification`. Expensive PHPUnit, random-order, package-isolation,
consumer, browser, platform, and release-integrity jobs are not started by the
main-feedback profile. This is event selection, not changed-package selection.

The two decisions are not interchangeable. Release-cut dispatches
`profile=full` on the exact release candidate and `bin/wait-for-green-ci`
requires the visible `ci/full-qualification` job to conclude successfully.
A successful main-feedback workflow cannot satisfy that publication boundary.
The tracked CI inventory and governed roster record the profile conditions.

### 1. `bin/check-pr-preflight` — one local command mirroring CI's repo-state gates

Runs every fast **repo-state** gate that hosted CI reports, using the same commands CI uses,
with the `run_gate` accumulator pattern from the `ci/verify-gates` job: every gate runs, all
failures are reported in one pass, each failure names its exact repair command, and the script
exits non-zero if any gate failed. Test suites (Unit / Integration / Architecture / frontend /
e2e) and hosted consumer/runtime lanes remain the long half of verification.
They are never executed by local preflight. A hosted-only manifest entry may
inventory a long lane's controls and report its owning check as
`hosted-required`, but cannot turn that lane into a local pass. Local preflight does not download or
execute FrankenPHP; missing the binary on a developer laptop must not become a
skip inside the hosted job. The preflight's job is that the long half never
discovers what the fast half could have said in seconds. The nightly
warn-only stale-spec-deferral scan (`bin/check-stale-spec-deferrals`,
`.github/workflows/nightly.yml` job `nightly/stale-spec-deferrals`) is also
**not** a preflight gate: it needs GitHub issue state (or an injected
snapshot), and the drift appears when an issue closes elsewhere rather than
when a batch lands.

Profiles:

- **default (`bin/check-pr-preflight`)** — every fast repo-state gate: composer policy, portable
  paths, the portable null device, package layers, symfony imports, the four S1 roster/contract gates, support contract,
  surface parity, changelog shape and fragment validation, ingestion defaults, secrets, governed secret access, runtime-policy custody, dispatcher
  keys, getquery bindings, admin coercion patterns, admin dist freshness, admin dist acceptance
  manifest, field guards, access hardening, contract-suite coverage, openapi, phpstan/phpunit path checks, distribution
  extensions, PHPUnit skip policy, delivery-agent event schema and append-only
  custody, repository-root hygiene, spec drift, changelog discipline, cs-check.
- **`--full`** — adds the phpstan-engine gates (`composer phpstan`, `bin/check-dead-code`) and
  reports the hosted-only `ci/split-artifact-acceptance` owner without launching its consumer build. These
  are in CI's blocking set; they are separated locally only because the PHPStan worker layer is
  environment-sensitive (documented WSL crashes) and cache-cold runs are minutes long. `--full` is
  the documented pre-landing command.

The gate list is **data, not prose**: `tools/preflight-gates.json` maps each gate id to its
command, repair command, profile, and the CI surface that enforces it. Schema 2 also resolves
execution owner (`local` or `hosted-only`), supported hosts, required capabilities, owning hosted check, relevant path selectors, cost class,
and evidence inputs for every gate. Common conservative values live in `gate_defaults`; a gate
override can narrow them but cannot remove its hosted owner. A self-test
(`tests/Architecture/PreflightParityTest`) asserts (a) every manifest gate resolves to a runnable
command, and (b) every gate names a CI enforcement surface that actually exists in the workflow
files — so the manifest cannot silently drift from CI.

Before launching a selected gate, preflight identifies the native host and the available PHP,
Git, Bash, Composer, and Node command capabilities. A supported and applicable gate runs normally.
A gate declared `hosted-only` is never launched on any local host. It is reported as
`hosted-required` with its owning check even on Linux, because a Linux workstation is not the
governed exact-SHA hosted runner. Its command and control inventory are executable ownership data,
not permission to substitute a local run for hosted proof.
A gate whose host or required capability is unavailable is `hosted-required`: it is not launched,
its owning hosted check is named, it is never printed as `ok`, and the ordinary command exits 3.
`--allow-hosted-required` exists only for the pre-push adapter: it permits publication so the
named hosted owner can run while preserving the incomplete result in stdout. It does not make the
gate pass, qualify a candidate, satisfy branch protection, or alter release-cut. A gate with an
explicit selector that matches no candidate path is `not-applicable`, also never printed as a
pass. Defects remain `failed` and exit 1.

Successful gate evidence is stored outside the checkout below Git's common directory. Its key
binds the complete selected path set, entry types and bytes, resolved base for base-relative gates,
`composer.lock`, native host and toolchain capabilities, profile, selectors, evidence inputs, and
the effective gate definition. The receipt separately retains the exact HEAD/tree and dirty-byte
identity on which the gate actually ran. An identical candidate prints `reused exact identity`; a
different candidate with the same material key prints `reused equivalent inputs from <origin>` and
the machine report preserves that origin. It never claims the gate ran on the new head. A changed
selected byte or gate definition invalidates only the affected receipt. `**` remains the
conservative selector default. Narrow selectors must include the command implementation,
configuration, dependency inputs, and complete data surface of that gate. Failed,
hosted-required, not-applicable, corrupt, or stale receipts are never reusable. `--no-reuse`
forces execution, `--evidence-dir` supplies an isolated store for tests, and `--report-json` writes
the four-state machine-readable report. Hosted CI and exact-SHA release gates do not consume local
receipts.

Vendor-freshness precondition (#2926): before any gate runs, preflight calls the shared,
dependency-free `bin/lib/vendor-freshness.php` against the repository root. It compares
`composer.lock` (packages and packages-dev — by name, version, and source/dist reference)
with `vendor/composer/installed.json`, and the PSR-4 namespaces a fresh dump must carry —
the root `composer.json`'s autoload and autoload-dev plus every locked package's autoload
(Composer never dumps a dependency's autoload-dev) — with `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php`. A stale or missing `vendor/`
short-circuits with `VENDOR_FRESHNESS_EXIT_CODE` (3 — distinct from 0 pass, 1 defect, 2 gate
infrastructure, 255 PHP fatal) and one actionable `vendor/ is stale relative to composer.lock —
run composer install` message; **no gate runs**, because their results against a stale
checkout would misreport environment faults as repository defects (an uncaught
`Opis\JsonSchema\Validator` fatal in the delivery-ledger gate; an "orphaned" public-surface
declaration whose repair is a CHANGELOG directive). The gates that dereference locked packages
or the autoloader — `bin/check-delivery-agent-events`, `tools/check-surface-parity.php`,
`bin/generate-surface-map` — run the same precondition themselves, so they behave identically
when invoked directly or by CI's `run_gate`. The precondition is deliberately **not** a manifest
gate: hosted CI installs fresh and can never observe this state, so a manifest entry would be a
no-op in CI while still needing an `enforced_by` surface; `bin/check-vendor-fresh` remains the
standalone local guard over the same library. `--list` does not require a fresh `vendor/`.

First-party source binding (#2972) is part of that same precondition. Package
identity alone cannot distinguish two checkouts with equal lock files, so the
guard also inspects the generated PSR-4, optimized classmap, and autoload-files
paths in Composer's compatibility maps (when Composer emits the optional files
map) and the runtime-static maps named by `autoload_real.php`. Candidate ownership comes from the root manifest and
from path-package lock entries whose declared path is lexically inside the
candidate; it never comes from a package or namespace naming convention. A
candidate-owned path package stays first-party when its source path is a
symlink, and fails when that symlink resolves outside the checkout. Every
first-party generated path, including a more-specific generated PSR-4 prefix
that could shadow an owned parent prefix, must likewise resolve inside the
canonical candidate root. A more-specific prefix declared by a third-party
package retains that ownership. Candidate-internal symlinks are valid;
Composer-valid missing PSR-4 leaf directories are contained through their
closest existing canonical ancestor. A donor symlink ancestor or dangling
symlink remains a refusal. Raw path components reach `realpath` before lexical
normalization, so `link/../missing` follows the link target's parent rather than
being collapsed inside the candidate. Autoload-file and classmap targets must exist.
Unrelated third-party package mappings are outside this containment rule. The guard reads generated
array declarations without invoking `vendor/autoload.php` or any autoloaded
file. A refusal identifies the map plane, owned declaration, observed path,
and expected candidate root. If `vendor/` itself is a symlink, its repair is
`unlink vendor && composer install`, affecting the candidate link only; the
guard never rewrites or regenerates the donor checkout. A nested
`vendor/composer` symlink is likewise unlinked in the candidate before install;
an ambiguous generated-metadata escape requires restoring that candidate
directory before running Composer.

State semantics: preflight evaluates the committed range against `origin/main` (or
`WAASEYAA_DRIFT_BASE`) **plus staged, unstaged, and untracked worktree files**. Spec-review
trailers remain commit metadata: a committed trailer cannot pre-approve a later worktree source
change, so that source change requires a corresponding worktree spec edit. Hosted CI omits the
worktree mode because its checkout is already an exact immutable hosted head.

Delivery-ledger custody has explicit local and hosted modes (#2900). The local
roster passes `--branch-base={base}` so unrelated main appends do not reject an
unchanged branch ledger. The dedicated `ci/verify-gates` step instead validates
committed candidate bytes against pinned accepted history, preserving the full
push baseline and binding PR merge parents. Strict native GitHub checks enforce
freshness for optional pinned-head PR landings. Direct sprint batches retain the
same local custody check and are observed by main CI. See
[delivery-telemetry.md](./delivery-telemetry.md).

### 2. `bin/refresh-governance-artifacts` — one refresh command

For every governed recorded artifact, one command knows how to repair it:

- **Mechanical artifacts** (regenerable with no human judgment): the four S1 rosters
  (`support/s1-*-roster.json`) and the dispatcher-key baseline. Refresh regenerates them via the
  verifiers' own write modes, then prints the resulting `git diff --stat` so the operator reviews
  what changed before committing.
- **Judgment artifacts** (entries need human-authored rationale): getquery-bindings baseline
  (entries require `# reason` comments), dead-code baseline (policy: shrink-only), public surface
  declarations (`packages/<pkg>/public-surface.php` — a `surface-parity` failure means a missing
  declaration or an unauthorized removal/downgrade, which only a human can settle; the tracked
  `docs/public-surface-map.php`/`.md` aggregates those declarations compose into are mechanical,
  regenerated by `bin/generate-surface-map --write` at the release cut, and the refresh instruction
  names that command — FW-DELIVERY-SURFACE-01 / #2901), symfony-import allowlist, access-hardening,
  governed-secret-access and runtime-policy-custody baselines,
  php-coverage baseline. Refresh does **not** rewrite these; it detects staleness and prints the
  exact regeneration or hand-edit instruction for each.

- **Policy authority** (the value is the policy, not a recording of code): `support/s1-v1.json`.
  `bin/check-support-contract` owns the contract's schema and invariants and derives every
  runtime, packaging, CI, and documentation expectation from the parsed contract (#2852); it
  carries no policy values of its own, so a support-policy change is one contract edit plus the
  real-surface change. Refresh prints that instruction; it never rewrites policy. The gate takes
  `--root=DIR` and `--contract=PATH` so `tests/Architecture/CheckSupportContractGateTest.php` can
  prove drift, malformed contracts, widening, and stale evidence fail closed against fixtures.

Refresh only touches artifacts whose gate currently fails — a clean tree is a no-op.

### 3. Worktree-inclusive local checks

Local gate runs must see what the developer sees:

- The S1 scanners (`bin/lib/s1-roster.php`) and `bin/check-access-hardening` derive their file
  list from git, not from a filesystem walk: `bin/lib/repository-files.php` runs
  `git ls-files -z --cached --others --exclude-standard [-- <scan root>...]`, so a scan sees
  tracked files plus untracked files git would add — and nothing else. The repository's ignore
  boundary is the exclusion *by construction*: nested git worktrees (`.worktrees/`,
  `.claude/worktrees/`), `packages/*/vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `storage/`, `tmp/` build caches
  and `.git/` itself never enter a scan, and git never descends into another repository's work
  tree, so a nested checkout is invisible whether or not it is ignored. There is no
  hand-maintained path denylist in any scanner (#2925 replaced the one #2865/#2866 kept
  extending — a filesystem walk minus a list re-creates the ignore boundary by hand and missed
  `.worktrees/` outright, producing 24,780 phantom findings in one developer clone). A root git
  cannot enumerate fails closed with a clear error; the scanners never fall back to a walk.
  Every git child the gates run drops git's repository-selecting environment
  (`REPOSITORY_LOCAL_GIT_ENVIRONMENT`: `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`,
  `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, ... — git's own `local_repo_env` list), because a pre-push hook run from a
  linked worktree exports `GIT_DIR=<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>`: without the scrub, `ls-files`
  would enumerate the hook's repository instead of the scan root, and the access-hardening
  self-test's fixture `git init` would reinitialise the developer's own gitdir as bare.
  `--exclude-standard` also honours the developer's global `core.excludesFile`, so a personal
  ignore can hide an *untracked* new file from a local scan until it is added (tracked files are
  unaffected; CI has no such file). Consequence for the mechanical rosters: `--write-*-roster`
  composes the scan, so it cannot record a non-repository path (a nested worktree, a nested
  `vendor/`, an ignored tree).
- Drift and changelog discipline combine the committed PR range with staged, unstaged, and
  untracked paths when invoked by preflight. A spec changed in an earlier commit does not cover a
  later uncommitted source edit; the spec must also change in the worktree. This preserves trailer
  provenance while making local results describe the tree the developer is actually reviewing.

### 4. Pre-push parity

`bin/project-hooks pre_push` runs `bin/check-pr-preflight` (default profile), **blocking**. The
advisory-local/blocking-CI split for spec drift is removed: drift failure blocks the push exactly
as a hosted diagnostic. The escape hatch for environmental failures (not real findings) remains
`git push --no-verify`, documented in CLAUDE.md; the phpstan-engine gates live in `--full`/CI per
§1 and are the one intentional difference between the pre-push profile and CI's blocking set —
recorded here, in the manifest, and in the hook's output, not implicit.

### 5. CI ordering — fast contracts gate the long jobs

The `support/s1-contract` job (~30s: support contract + all four S1 roster gates) and `spec-drift`
job are `needs:` prerequisites of the PHPUnit shard plan/execution and the random-order job.
The required `ci/unit-tests` and `ci/coverage` contexts aggregate the same shard result and Clover
evidence without executing PHPUnit again. A stale roster or spec therefore fails in its owning
fast job, and the long jobs never start or re-report the same failure. On non-PR events `spec-drift` completes
with an explicit no-PR-diff result, so push and dispatch runs retain the same dependency graph.
Required-check names remain unchanged. Pull-request concurrency cancels superseded revisions;
push/main evidence is never cancelled.

### 6. Recorded-roster identity: semantic, not positional

S1 roster entries (schema version 2) bind exactly what makes an occurrence *that occurrence*:

```
{ path, pattern, class, match_sha256, occurrence }
```

- `match_sha256` — hash of the normalized matched text (the semantic content).
- `occurrence` — 1-based index of this `(path, pattern, match_sha256)` triple within the file, so
  multiplicity is preserved (two identical matches are two entries).
- **Dropped entirely**: `line`, `line_sha256`, `source_sha256`. They were derived display data
  bound into identity; storing them made every unrelated edit to a rostered file (even a new
  import line) invalidate the roster. Failure output derives live line numbers at report time —
  fresh by construction, never stored.

Consequence: a roster changes **iff the governed surface changes** — a match added, removed, or
moved across files/patterns. Whitespace, comments, imports, and unrelated edits in rostered files
no longer require regeneration commits. The verifiers still fail closed on unclassified
candidates, and all semantic anchors / contract assertions are unchanged.

Applies to all four S1 rosters: `s1-configuration-activation`, `s1-configuration-authority`,
`s1-schema-authority`, `s1-sqlite-construction`.

### 7. Repository-root hygiene — stricter than `.gitignore`, sees what `git status` cannot

`bin/check-repo-root-hygiene` (#2927) fails when the repository root holds any entry that is
neither Git-tracked nor on its explicit, source-annotated allowlist of expected local entries
(`vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `tmp/`, `build/`, `node-compile-cache/`, `.worktrees/`, `.kittify/`,
`.env`, tool caches, IDE and agent-CLI directories, the `support-contract-evidence.json` the
`support/s1-contract` job writes — every entry cites its `.gitignore` or `ci.yml` origin). Two
design points are load-bearing:

- It enumerates the **literal filesystem** (`scandir`), never `git status` or `git ls-files`
  alone, so an **empty untracked directory** is a finding. 363 of the 734 stray entries that
  motivated the gate were empty `waaseyaa_loader_test_*` directories, and `git status --porcelain`
  was empty with all of them present.
- It is **deliberately stricter than `.gitignore`**. The leak families ignored at `.gitignore`
  lines 110-135 (plus the older `waaseyaa-sync-*` / `waaseyaa_oidc_jwks_*` rules) hide leaks from
  `git status`, which is exactly why they accumulated; the gate reports them as
  "known leak family" findings with the producer label.

It runs in `ci/composer-policy` on the pristine checkout and again **after** each PHPUnit shard and
random-order shard, so a test that leaks into the root fails the run that leaked. Locally it is in
the default preflight profile (pre-push). It has no recorded baseline, so
`bin/refresh-governance-artifacts` has nothing to regenerate: the repair is to delete the stray
entry, or — only for a genuinely expected local artifact — to add it to `EXPECTED_LOCAL_ENTRIES`
with its source. Fixture proof: `tests/Architecture/CheckRepoRootHygieneGateTest.php`.

The gate's one git child (`git -C <root> ls-files -z`) runs with git's repository-selecting
environment scrubbed (`REPOSITORY_LOCAL_GIT_ENVIRONMENT` in the script: `GIT_DIR`,
`GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`, `GIT_CONFIG*`,
`GIT_PREFIX`, `GIT_NAMESPACE`, and the rest of git's own `local_repo_env`). Git hooks export
`GIT_DIR` (a pre-push from a linked worktree carries `GIT_DIR=<main>/.git/worktrees/<name>`),
and `bin/project-hooks` runs the preflight — hence this gate — with that environment intact;
without the scrub, `git -C <root>` enumerated the hook's repository, so a stray root entry that
happened to be tracked there passed. The fixture test's hostile-`GIT_DIR` case proves the
enumeration is the target repository's and the target's `core.bare` stays `false`.

**Producer trace (recorded so nobody repeats it).** The only in-repo producer of the
`waaseyaa_loader_test_*` name is `packages/foundation/tests/Unit/Migration/MigrationLoaderArrayFormTest.php`
(`sys_get_temp_dir() . '/waaseyaa_loader_test_' . uniqid()`), unchanged since authored (`git log -S`)
and byte-identical in every worktree; `waaseyaa_test_lock_*` is the same shape in
`packages/cli/tests/Unit/Command/Import/Import*CommandTest.php`. Neither writes to the root as
written: `sys_get_temp_dir()` resolves to `/tmp` on the host today, `TMPDIR` is unset, and no
`TMPDIR`/`sys_temp_dir` override exists in `bin/`, `tools/`, `Taskfile.yml`, `phpunit.xml.dist`,
or any workflow. The reproducible **mechanism** is a relative `TMPDIR`: PHP returns the value
verbatim (`TMPDIR=.` → `sys_get_temp_dir() === '.'`), so every scratch path lands in the process
working directory, and a run killed before `tearDown()` (OOM at the default `memory_limit`, or a
harness timeout) leaves the empty directories behind. That both `waaseyaa_loader_test_6a0d*` and
`waaseyaa_test_lock_6a0d*` (same `uniqid()` prefix, i.e. the same run) were later found together in a
*different* project root corroborates an environment-bound trigger rather than a code defect. The
exact invocation that set it during the 2026-05-22..24 accumulation window was not recoverable (no
session transcripts survive from that period). Source-level fix: `tests/bootstrap.php` now refuses
to start the suite when `sys_get_temp_dir()` is non-absolute or IS the repository root
(`tests/Support/TempDirGuard.php`, proven by `tests/Architecture/PhpunitTempDirGuardTest.php`), so
"absolute" is decided by the platform the process runs on, not by the shape of the string: on
POSIX only a leading `/` qualifies (a `TMPDIR=C:\Temp` on Linux/WSL is a *relative* name that
`realpath()` cannot resolve and scratch paths land in the cwd); on Windows only drive-rooted
(`C:\`, `C:/`) or UNC (`\\server\share`) paths qualify, never drive-relative `C:foo` or
current-drive-rooted `\foo` — and the proof exercises both semantics on every OS,
the mechanism fails loudly before the first write instead of silently. Native Windows PHP
ignores `TMPDIR` and reads `TMP`, then `TEMP`, resolving a relative value against the working
directory, so `TMP=.` yields the checkout itself and the root check refuses it; the guard's
recovery guidance names the variables the host reads. The `native-host-contract` CI matrix runs
this proof, and `bin/check-repo-root-hygiene` before and after its tests, natively on
`ubuntu-24.04` and `windows-2025` (#2678).

### 8. Host-portable gate execution (#3096)

`bin/check-pr-preflight` runs each manifest command through the host shell: `sh` on POSIX,
`cmd.exe` on native Windows. From PowerShell or cmd, a bare `bash` is
`C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`, the WSL launcher, whose Linux Git cannot read a Windows linked
worktree. On native Windows the runner therefore starts every selected gate whose command begins
with exactly `bash` with Git for Windows Bash (`repository_bash_command()`,
`bin/lib/repository-bash.php`, #2679). It resolves that Bash once per run and quotes it for
`cmd.exe`, leaving the rest of the command unchanged. If it cannot be resolved or quoted, no gate
runs: the runner exits with the shared precondition code (3) and prints no repair guidance, because
this is a host fault, not a repository finding. POSIX command strings are never rewritten. Whether
the runner is started from a native shell or from Git's `sh` by a pre-push hook, Bash gates run
with Git for Windows `bash`, `grep` and `find`, while `php`, `git` and `python3` are native Windows
programs. A gate failure on that host must mean a repository finding, never an unstartable child
process or an untranslated path. Gates therefore follow these rules:

- **Child processes start from argument arrays**, not shell strings. A POSIX `VAR=value cmd
  2>/dev/null` line does not run under `cmd.exe`, and a child that never starts can read as a
  detection failure (the PL008 self-test) or a silently lost value (the runner's own
  `git config waaseyaa.driftBase` lookup). Environment overrides go in the `proc_open`
  environment array; discarded stderr uses the `['null']` descriptor. `bin/check-portable-null-device`
  enforces the null-device half statically for all governed production PHP: a hard-coded `/dev/null`
  descriptor always fails, and every other `/dev/null` literal must be classified
  ([native-host-support.md](native-host-support.md#portable-null-device-guard-fw-2678-portable-null-device-03)).
- **PHP gates that need the governed repository Git entrypoint start it through
  `repository_git_command()`** (`bin/lib/repository-git.php`). On POSIX hosts that is the
  stash-refusing `bin/git` adapter. On native Windows, where `bin/git` is a POSIX-only Bash
  entrypoint that CreateProcess cannot start, it is the Windows Git executable
  (`WAASEYAA_SYSTEM_GIT` when a harness pins one, otherwise `git` from PATH). This is the host rule
  in `docs/governance/agent-contract.md`. A Git that cannot start fails the gate closed. Current
  callers: `bin/check-pr-preflight` (drift-base lookup), `bin/check-delivery-agent-events`,
  `bin/check-covers-nothing-companions`.
- **Existing read-only repository enumeration may use `repositoryGit()`**
  (`bin/lib/repository-files.php`, §3). It starts `git` from PATH with the repository-selecting
  environment (`REPOSITORY_LOCAL_GIT_ENVIRONMENT`) scrubbed, so a hook's `GIT_DIR` cannot redirect
  it to another repository, and it runs natively on both hosts. It does not pass through the
  `bin/git` adapter, so it is limited to queries that leave the developer repository's refs, index
  and working tree unchanged (for example `bin/check-landing-base` and
  `bin/check-package-coverage-history`) and to disposable self-test fixtures, such as the fixture
  `git init` in `bin/check-access-hardening`.
- **Bash gates use only what Git for Windows Bash provides.** Patterns use `grep -E`, because
  that `grep` rejects `-P` in its default locale. Native interpreters receive relative paths or
  argv data, never MSYS paths such as `/c/...` interpolated into program source.
- **Self-tests count only a genuine detection.** A negative control passes only when the gate
  exits with its violation status *and* reports the planted violator; a scan error, launch
  failure or crash fails the self-test.

No gate in the default profile currently needs a `not-run-here` outcome. If a gate ever depends on
a capability that genuinely cannot run on a host, it must report a distinct `not-run-here` result
that the runner never counts as `ok` and that never lowers its exit status. Fixture proofs:
`tests/Architecture/PackageLayersPl008SelfTestTest.php`,
`tests/Architecture/AdminCoercionPatternsGateTest.php`,
`tests/Architecture/RepositoryGitEntrypointTest.php`,
`tests/Architecture/CoversNothingCompanionDiagnosticTest.php`,
`tests/Architecture/CheckIngestionDefaultsGateTest.php`, and the host-quoted fixtures in
`tests/Architecture/PreflightParityTest.php`. The native-host classification of these entrypoints
remains owned by `docs/specs/native-host-support.md`; passing locally on Windows is not a support
claim until a native Windows CI job executes them.

## Invariants

1. Every fast repository-state gate mirrored by hosted CI is in
   `tools/preflight-gates.json` (enforced by
   `PreflightParityTest` against the workflow files).
2. Every governed recorded artifact has exactly one documented repair path, reachable from
   `bin/refresh-governance-artifacts` output.
3. A gate failure message names its repair command.
4. Roster identity never binds line numbers or whole-file hashes.
5. Local scanner scope is the git repository boundary — tracked plus untracked-not-ignored
   files, enumerated by `bin/lib/repository-files.php` — so non-repository content (nested
   worktrees, `packages/*/vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `storage/`, `tmp/`, `.git/`, nested
   checkouts) can never contribute a finding, and a local run and a CI run of the same gate agree
   on the same tree. Fixtures: `tests/Integration/Tooling/S1RosterLibraryTest.php`,
   `tests/Architecture/AccessHardeningGateTest.php`.

Each builds a disposable consumer with its own dependency graph, so each needs network access and minutes of Composer work. Their commands are never locally executed by preflight. `split-artifact-acceptance` is the manifest exception: its `hosted-only` entry makes every live surface, reserved surface, seeded negative control, required capability, and `ci/split-artifact-acceptance` owner machine-readable while always reporting `hosted-required` locally. Their fast repo-state halves run in `ci/unit-tests` through `FreshInstallBootGateTest`, `PackagedSkillResourcesTest`, `CliHealthReportGateTest`, `CliSyncRulesGateTest`, and `SplitArtifactAcceptanceGateTest`, keeping harness shape and CI wiring under checks a developer can run in seconds. `ci/split-artifact-acceptance` (#2649) also re-runs every assertion against seeded corruption on each invocation. A control the host cannot seed is `not-run-here` in the §8 sense (#3081): never counted as caught and never lowering an undetected failure. Native Windows without symlink privilege reports the run incomplete (exit 3), not passed; every other host fails closed, so the Linux job must execute every control. |
| Hosted FrankenPHP worker runtime | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `ci/frankenphp-worker`, pin `tools/frankenphp-runtime-pin.json`, harness `scripts/acceptance-frankenphp-worker.sh`. Owns real worker lifetime, Caddy/FrankenPHP identity, sequential/concurrent requests through one worker PID (concurrent burst captures per-request PID headers), hermetic runtime storage under `WAASEYAA_STORAGE_PATH`, account/community isolation at the HTTP boundary, streamed `/api/broadcast`, error-then-recovery, classic `php-server` fallback, and clean shutdown. Does **not** replace PHPUnit static lifetime gates (#2069, GraphQL schema-cache bleed, Twig environment replacement, CommunityMiddleware unit tests). |

### Binary PHP names in the isolated autoloader probe

The runtime-static freshness probe transports class-map entries as a list of base64-encoded names and unchanged file paths within JSON. The parent decodes names before applying the existing source ownership and map-coherence checks. PHP permits high-byte class identifiers; Symfony Cache's internal value wrapper uses one. Such a name does not imply corrupt Composer output. List entries preserve even names whose encoded text is numeric, avoiding PHP map-key coercion. Invalid transport refuses, and all donor/freshness checks remain active. No vendor files are rewritten by this read-only probe.
