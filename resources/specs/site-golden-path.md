## Purpose

A fresh Waaseyaa application must make its product and architecture decisions
explicit before feature implementation, generate supported first-party
integration patterns from those decisions, and fail closed when the resulting
application bypasses declared framework boundaries.

The golden path is provider-neutral. Its authority is a versioned application
manifest, local executable commands, portable Git revision identities, Composer
provenance, and generated tests. A forge or hosted CI system may execute those
commands, but GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo, Gitea, or any other provider is an
adapter, never part of the application contract.

## Authoritative artifacts

The Layer 0 `waaseyaa/site-contract` package owns the schema, typed values,
deterministic parser, canonical manifest identity, and version-disposition
policy. It has no dependency on a forge, CI provider, CLI, generator, runtime
container, recipe package, or application.

Every initialized application owns these files:

- `.waaseyaa/site.yaml`: canonical capability manifest;
- `.waaseyaa/site.schema.json`: the exact framework schema version understood
  when the manifest was last migrated;
- `.waaseyaa/generated.json`: generator version, manifest identity, managed
  artifact modes and digests, and declared extension-region identity;
- `.waaseyaa/.gitignore`: provider-neutral exclusion of the runtime lock,
  transaction journal, and recoverable staging residue;
- `AGENTS.md`: generated agent and maintainer instructions that point back to
  the manifest and executable gates;
- `tests/Architecture/SiteContractTest.php`: application contract and bypass
  checks;
- `tests/Acceptance/SiteGoldenPathTest.php`: generated behavior checks for
  active recipes; and
- `bin/maintenance/site-verify`: provider-neutral command that runs manifest,
  architecture, strict-doctor, and generated acceptance gates in canonical
  order.

`.waaseyaa/generated.json` binds every managed artifact to the generator
version and content digest that produced it. User-owned extension regions are
explicit; regeneration refuses an unrecognized edit instead of overwriting it.

## Optional management conformance

FW-AGENT-MANAGEMENT-01 adds an independently authored optional
`.waaseyaa/management.json` companion; it does not alter site.yaml or generated
artifact ownership. Layer 0 owns its closed structure and conformance vocabulary.
Product adapters own actual registration and executed checks. No companion keeps
legacy doctor behavior; a companion without live inventory is unverified.

Management receipts bind operation, site and complete management input digests.
The architecture scanner's filtered source digest is deliberately insufficient
for that purpose. CLI ManagementInputDiscovery includes all regular input-tree
files and directories, dependency bytes, locks and modes, excluding only Git
metadata. Outputs live outside the stable input tree. Symlinks, special entries
and unreadable inputs refuse. Report `management_input_sha256` is separate from
`source_sha256` and companion-byte `management_sha256`.
The full structure, identity algorithm, diagnostic codes and evidence limits are
in [agent-management.md](agent-management.md). This companion does not authorize
execution, sign receipts, attest deployment or fork blueprint/generation policy.

## Capability manifest

The manifest has a strict versioned schema. Unknown keys, duplicate capability
identities, invalid state transitions, and unsupported schema versions fail.
Every known capability is exactly one of:

- `active`: implemented now and required to pass its recipe and verification;
- `planned`: intentionally absent from runtime, with an owner-visible note; or
- `not_needed`: intentionally excluded with a non-empty reason.

Installed packages do not imply activation. Conversely, an active capability
must declare the package/provider, configuration authority, public routes,
data classification, lifecycle operations, and verification appropriate to
that capability.

The top-level manifest binds:

- schema and generator versions;
- application identity;
- framework revision policy and observed lock digest;
- canonical origin as configuration authority, never a source literal;
- content types and canonical route templates;
- active, planned, and excluded capabilities;
- personal-data stores and their consent, retention, export, and deletion
  operations;
- selected generated recipes and their artifact digests; and
- the provider-neutral verification command.

When governed visual authoring is active, the manifest also declares the
authoritative revisionable page bundle, layout field, block/layout/template
registry, preview route owner, editorial permissions, and every enabled client
surface. `admin_spa` and `anokii` are clients of one page-builder service and
wire contract; they can never select different page stores, validators, or
publication paths.

Manifest migration is explicit and produces a reviewable diff. Runtime boot
never silently rewrites it.

### Governed application blueprints

`waaseyaa.site` v1 may contain one optional, closed
`application_blueprint` section (ADR-023). It describes a model-independent
application proposal: entities and fields, relationships, permissions and
roles, policies, workflows, fixtures, and generated behavioural checks. The
exact vocabulary and semantic constraints are owned by the Layer 0
`waaseyaa/site-contract` package; a product may not substitute a private DTO,
validator, or compiler.

The optional section does not change the normalized shape of a manifest that
omits it. Existing v1 manifests therefore render to the same bytes and retain
their existing digest. Presence of the section derives the required generator
feature token `site-application-blueprint-v1`. Generator feature tokens are a
runtime-negotiation roster separate from authored `capabilities` and recipe
capability references. An older closed parser rejects the unknown section, and
a newer parser refuses dry-run rendering or publication when the installed
generator cohort does not advertise that exact feature. No cohort may silently
ignore a blueprint. Negotiation is `site:init`'s first act after parsing:
`GeneratorFeatureNegotiation::assert()` compares the manifest's required
tokens with the roster the installed root compilers advertise
(`SiteArtifactRendererFactory::advertisedGeneratorFeatures()`), and a missing
token is `GEN007_UNSUPPORTED_DECLARATION` at `/application_blueprint`
(ADR-025 D-5) before any render, lock, journal or write, identically in
dry-run and apply, with no change receipt. In activated 01D-2 the closed
feature roster advertises the blueprint compiler token; no other additive
compiler is implied or admitted.

The manifest document remains byte/digest stable when the section is absent,
but the generated `.waaseyaa/site.schema.json` necessarily changes when the
optional property is added. An initialized site takes the existing
changed-managed-bytes upgrade path: rebind
`framework.observed_lock_sha256` to the reviewed dependency lock and re-run
`site:init`. This is not the unrecoverable changed-artifact-set case. Until the
rebind, strict doctor, generated verification, and the generated architecture
test are red; today's `SITE010_GENERATED_ARTIFACT_DRIFT` wording classifies the
mismatch as artifact drift. 01D-2 retains the `SITE010` family for schema
changes and invalid applied evidence. A dependency upgrade requires review and
manifest lock rebinding; for a blueprint, the changed manifest digest also
requires a new matching approval. Strict verification never repairs either
condition implicitly.

Authored YAML contains the proposal, never mutation authority. The canonical
blueprint digest covers its fixed schema id, contract version, and complete
payload; the section also participates in the full site-manifest digest. An
approval or rejection receipt is separate request evidence that binds the
decision and claimed actor identifier to both exact digests. That binding
prevents transfer after proposal/context drift; actor authenticity is only as
strong as the higher-layer decision mechanism. Parsing, validation,
negotiation and pure compilation need no approval: the compiled plan is the
approval-free review surface. Engine evaluation of a plan under the blueprint
compiler — `site:init --dry-run` and apply alike — requires an `approved`
receipt matching the manifest re-parsed from the plan's own
`.waaseyaa/site.yaml` row and is otherwise `GEN011_UNAUTHORIZED_SET_DELTA`
(ADR-025 D-13 item 5). The receipt is a separate `--decision-receipt` input
on every invocation, never a member of the apply request (#2787 01D-2).

The engine's closed additive roster admits exactly
`Waaseyaa\SiteContract\Generation\SiteArtifactRenderer` and
`Waaseyaa\CLI\Site\Blueprint\ApplicationBlueprintCompiler`. Both own the
managed root `site`; no other additive or seeded compiler is enabled. The
blueprint compiler is separate from the legacy renderer's recipe composition.
The engine normalizes the typed receipt, checks the declared compiler and the
embedded manifest's digest/version before lock creation or journal recovery,
and repeats admission during locked preparation. A legacy renderer plan cannot
carry blueprint content to bypass that check. Malformed CLI receipt documents
normalize to `SITE050_DECISION_RECEIPT_INVALID`; structurally invalid engine
receipts refuse with `GEN011_UNAUTHORIZED_SET_DELTA`.

The existing metadata writer composes optional top-level
`application_blueprint` evidence in `.waaseyaa/generated.json`: exactly
`{generator_feature, decision_receipt}`, with the blueprint feature token and
the canonical closed Approved receipt. A persisted blueprint manifest requires
matching evidence before any unit update. The root remains implicit, without
a `units[]` row or stored compiler FQCN. Blueprint-free metadata retains its
existing bytes. Approved plain-to-blueprint additive growth is supported;
blueprint-to-plain downgrade is refused, and non-root updates preserve evidence.

Terminal blueprint change receipts identify their validated approval with
`BlueprintDecisionReceipt::digest()`: SHA-256 of `canonicalJson()` without a
newline. This identifies content and does not authenticate the claimed actor.
An apply may supply another valid approval of the same manifest after preview;
the later invocation records its own approval. Recovery and residue receipts
have no authority to claim that later blueprint decision, so their decision ID
is absent. The terminal new blueprint operation carries its validated decision
and is caused by the preceding recovery receipt when present. Existing plain
generation receipt context and recovery-only behavior remain compatible.

`BlueprintAppliedEvidence` is the shared closed parser used by the engine and
doctor. Matching durable evidence projects `Applied`, even when a current
request rejects the same manifest. Otherwise a matching current decision
projects `Approved` or `Rejected`; valid stale applied evidence projects
`Superseded`; without either, the blueprint remains `Proposed`. Invalid evidence
cannot be passed as proof. Strict doctor recompiles and verifies the complete
artifact and registration projection using the existing execution authority's
read-only evaluation. Missing, malformed, rejected, mismatched, or
success-shaped evidence produces `SITE010_GENERATED_ARTIFACT_DRIFT`.

The process boundary remains `site:init --json --answers <manifest.yaml>
--decision-receipt <receipt.json> [--dry-run] [--yes]`, followed by
`site:doctor --strict --format=json`. JSON preserves literal artifact bytes and
the existing success/error envelopes. The console application retains its
existing 0/success and 1/failure normalization of command-handler exit codes.
Committed process fixtures cover planned, applied, no-change, unapproved and
malformed-receipt outcomes; volatile receipt identifiers and issuance timestamps
are normalized only in test snapshots, never in process output.

The initializer installs composed evidence last in its existing transaction,
alongside the artifact and registration changes. Artifact bytes remain a pure
function of the manifest; approval evidence belongs to transaction-owned
metadata (ADR-025 D-2.6, D-10.1).

`waaseyaa.generated` remains version 1. Its optional
`application_blueprint` evidence member is emitted only for an applied
blueprint. Older readers reject the extended closed shape; newer readers accept
both the historical exact v1 shape and the extended shape. The blueprint-free
metadata bytes remain unchanged.

AI systems are untrusted proposal producers. Provider names, prompts,
transcripts, confidence, and repair metadata remain outside the contract. A
human-authored proposal and an AI-proposed one pass through the same parser,
validator, exact-digest decision boundary, initializer, and verifier.

The blueprint compiler is
`Waaseyaa\CLI\Site\Blueprint\ApplicationBlueprintCompiler`: a distinct root
compiler with its own `generator.fqcn` that composes
`SiteArtifactRenderer::compile()` and pure emitters into the root `site`
unit's `ArtifactPlan`, declaring `set_evolution: additive` purely (#2787
01D-1; design in `docs/change-records/FW-SITE-BLUEPRINT-01.md`). 01D-2
activates the execution and verification boundaries above under ADR-025 D-13.
Governance emission, behavioural checks and fixture seeding are subsequent
work packages.

A compiled blueprint's governance is default deny (#2788, design in
`docs/change-records/FW-SITE-BLUEPRINT-01.md` "Work package 01E"). The
compiler emits, through the same factory roster and never a parallel
authority: a permission catalogue naming every declared permission; one
`#[PolicyAttribute]` access policy per entity that declares a policy,
discovered and composed by the framework's own `AccessPolicyRegistry` and
`EntityAccessHandler`, which starts every decision Neutral, returns Allowed
only for a declared `(operation, permission, condition)` rule, never returns
an entity-level Forbidden, and never inspects roles — while sealing the
entity's authorization inputs at the field level through
`FieldAccessPolicyInterface` (the `keys.owner` field is not editable once
the entity is persisted and the `workflow_state` selector is never editable
outside a transition); a workflow definition per declared workflow in the
shipped `DefaultWorkflows` shape, seeded additively by a generated
governance provider that also contributes the declared roles through
`ProvidesRolesInterface` and the declared permissions through
`ProvidesPermissionsInterface` (the kernel composes one permission catalogue
from every such contribution plus `extra.waaseyaa.permissions`, binds it as
`PermissionHandlerInterface`, and refuses to boot when a provider-declared
role grants an uncatalogued permission); the authored
`workflows.assignments` sync entry per binding; and companion tests for the
declared checks, a default-deny test, and — whenever a policy is declared —
a JSON:API companion that drives every entity through the real
`JsonApiController` create, list, show, update and delete methods with
allowed, denied and near-miss principals. A workflow-bound generated entity
carries the `workflow_state` selector only; it never fabricates Node's
`status` field. An entity without a policy is denied every operation;
roles reach accounts only through `user:assign-role`; an `administrator`
role id, an `ownership` or `workflow_state` condition on `create`, and a
wildcard permission are refused before any artifact is produced. Generated
types are not exposed on generic JSON:API routes by generation (exposure is
the operator's `api.entity_type_allowlist` decision), and binding
activation remains a verified `config:import`, not a boot-time write.

### Closed vocabulary (#2785)

Namespace `Waaseyaa\SiteContract\Blueprint\`. Every list is a closed mapping
(`additionalProperties: false`); every id uses the manifest's stable-id
grammar `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$` except a permission id/reference, which uses
`^[a-z0-9_-]+( [a-z0-9_-]+)*$` (lowercase words, single spaces; a literal `*`
anywhere is `SITE045`, never a silent grammar failure).

- **`entities`** (min 1) — `id` (must equal an existing `content_types[].id`),
  `label`, `storage` (`BlueprintStorage`: `sql-blob` | `sql-column`, equal to
  `Waaseyaa\Entity\Storage\PrimaryStorageBackend::SQL_BLOB`/`SQL_COLUMN`),
  `revisionable`, `translatable`, `keys` (`id`, `uuid`, `label` always;
  `revision` iff `revisionable`; `langcode`/`default_langcode` iff
  `translatable`; optional `owner` naming a relationship field on this
  entity), `fields` (each: `id`, `type` — `BlueprintFieldType`, the 13
  `#[FieldType(id: ...)]` ids under `packages/field/src/Item/` minus
  `entity_reference` (owned by relationships), `file`, and `image` (media is
  out of scope) — `required`, `cardinality` (≥1 or `-1`), `translatable`,
  `revisionable`, `indexed` (requires `sql-column`), `values` (required iff
  `type: enum`, forbidden otherwise)).
- **`relationships`** — `id`, `from: {entity, field}` (the field id created on
  that entity), `to: {entity}`, `cardinality`, `required`, `on_delete`
  (`BlueprintOnDelete`: `restrict` | `nullify`).
- **`permissions`** — `id`, `title`.
- **`roles`** — `id`, `label`, `permissions` (unique refs into `permissions`).
- **`policies`** — default-deny; `id`, `entity`, `operation`
  (`BlueprintOperation`: `view` | `create` | `update` | `delete`),
  `condition` (`BlueprintConditionKind`, `kind`-dispatched closed shape):
  `permission` → `{kind, permission}`; `ownership` → `{kind, permission}`
  (requires `entity.keys.owner`, `SITE046`); `workflow_state` → `{kind,
  permission, states}` (requires the entity bound to exactly one workflow).
  No expression, script, callable, or regex condition exists.
- **`workflows`** — `id`, `label`, `initial_state`, `states` (min 1: `id`,
  `label`, `published`), `transitions` (`id`, `label`, `from` (state ids),
  `to`, `permission`), `bindings` (`{entity}`; the entity must be
  revisionable and not translatable, `SITE043`; an entity binds to at most
  one workflow across all workflows).
- **`fixtures`** — `id`, `entity`, `values` (closed to the entity's declared
  fields plus its relationship `from.field`s; a relationship value is a
  fixture id — or list, per cardinality — of the relationship's `to.entity`),
  optional `workflow_state` (only when the entity is bound). A value's shape
  and type are checked against its field/relationship declaration: cardinality
  `1` requires a scalar (`SITE010` for a list), cardinality other than `1`
  requires a list of scalars; the scalar's PHP type must match the field type
  (string/text/email/link/date/datetime/json/list → string; integer → int;
  float/decimal → int or float; boolean → bool; enum → a string that is one of
  the field's declared `values`, `SITE042` otherwise); `null` is accepted only
  when the field/relationship is not `required` (`SITE011` otherwise); a
  `required` field or relationship absent from `values` entirely is `SITE011`
  at that field's pointer.

The field-type roster is a Layer-0 closed mirror, not a second discovery
mechanism. `FieldTypeManager::blueprintFieldTypeIds()` is the live Layer-1
admission authority; each plugin declares whether it is directly admissible.
The root `ApplicationBlueprintVocabularyTest` instantiates that registry and
proves exact equality with `BlueprintFieldType::cases()`. This keeps
`site-contract` free of an upward dependency while ensuring a newly registered,
removed, or reclassified field type cannot drift silently into or out of the
blueprint contract (#2786).

- **`checks`** (`BlueprintCheckKind`, `kind`-dispatched): `role_permission`
  (`role`, `permission`, `expect: granted|denied`); `workflow_transition`
  (`role`, `workflow`, `transition`, `expect: allowed|denied`);
  `entity_access` (`role`, `entity`, `operation`, optional `fixture`,
  `expect: allow|deny`); `fixture_present` (`fixture`).

Authority-bearing keys (`state`, `status`, `approved`, `applied`, `approval`,
`decision`, `receipt`, `lifecycle`) are not in any closed shape at any level —
authoring one fails `SITE001_UNKNOWN_KEY`, never silently accepted or ignored.

**Canonical order.** Each id-keyed collection (`entities`, `relationships`,
`permissions`, `roles`, `policies`, `workflows`, `fixtures`, `checks`, and
`fields`/`states`/`transitions` within their parent) is emitted sorted by id.
`roles[].permissions`, `transitions[].from`, enum `values`, and
`workflow_state` condition `states` are sorted `SORT_STRING`. Optional scalars
with defaults are always emitted (`required: false`, `cardinality: 1`,
`translatable: false`, `revisionable: false`, `indexed: false`, `on_delete:
restrict`); optional keys with no default (`keys.owner`, `fixtures[].workflow_state`,
non-enum `values`, …) are omitted, never emitted as `null`. `fixtures[].values`
data (scalar lists, not structural collections) keeps authored order.

Canonical (sorted-by-id) order is applied ONLY when producing the normalized
section, its canonical JSON, and its digest — the typed `ApplicationBlueprint`
and its nested value objects otherwise preserve AUTHORED order (YAML list
order, exactly as parsed). `ApplicationBlueprintValidator`'s JSON Pointer
paths therefore always name the offending entry's authored position, never a
canonicalized one — reordering an authored document never changes which index
an error is reported at, and never changes the digest either.

**Digest formula.** `ApplicationBlueprint::$digest` is `sha256` over the
canonical JSON of `{schema: "waaseyaa.application_blueprint",
contract_version: 1, payload: <normalized section without contract_version>}`.
It participates independently from the full site-manifest digest: a blueprint
value change moves both; a manifest-context-only change (e.g.
`application.name`) moves only the manifest digest.

**Error codes** (JSON Pointer paths rooted at `/application_blueprint`; generic
manifest codes `SITE001`/`SITE010`–`SITE012`/`SITE014`/`SITE020`/`SITE021`
apply for ordinary shape/type/duplicate failures):

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `SITE040_BLUEPRINT_UNSUPPORTED_CONTRACT_VERSION` | `contract_version` other than `1` |
| `SITE041_BLUEPRINT_UNKNOWN_CONTENT_TYPE` | an entity id is not a `content_types[].id` |
| `SITE042_BLUEPRINT_UNRESOLVED_REFERENCE` | any dangling entity/field/permission/role/workflow/state/fixture/transition reference |
| `SITE043_BLUEPRINT_WORKFLOW_BINDING_UNSUPPORTED` | bound entity not revisionable, or translatable, or bound twice |
| `SITE044_BLUEPRINT_FIELD_PREREQUISITE` | field/key flags don't match their entity prerequisite, or `values` mismatches `type` |
| `SITE045_BLUEPRINT_WILDCARD_PERMISSION` | `*` anywhere in a permission id or reference |
| `SITE046_BLUEPRINT_OWNERSHIP_FIELD_REQUIRED` | an `ownership` condition on an entity without `keys.owner` |
| `SITE047_BLUEPRINT_UNSUPPORTED_CONDITION` | an unknown condition/check `kind` |
| `SITE050_DECISION_RECEIPT_INVALID` | a decision receipt fails its closed shape or grammar |

Structural shape/grammar/per-collection-duplicate-id checks
(`ApplicationBlueprintParser`) fail first; cross-collection semantic checks
(`ApplicationBlueprintValidator`, invoked immediately after by
`SiteManifestParser::parse()`) run once the whole section is typed.

### Decision receipt and lifecycle (#2785, ADR-023 D-4/D-5)

`Blueprint\BlueprintDecisionReceipt::fromArray()` types a closed mapping
(`schema` = `waaseyaa.blueprint_decision`, `version` = `1`, `decision`
(`BlueprintDecision`: `approved` | `rejected`), `blueprint_digest`,
`manifest_digest` (both sha256), `actor`, `decided_at` (RFC 3339 UTC,
`^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}Z$`), `mechanism`). It is request input,
not a second site file — `site-contract` defines its shape and exact-digest
matching only; a higher layer decides how one is produced, authenticated, or
retained. `matches(SiteManifest $manifest)` is true only when both digests
equal the manifest's current ones. `Blueprint\BlueprintLifecycleResolver::resolve()`
derives `BlueprintLifecycle` (`proposed` | `approved` | `rejected`) from a
manifest and an optional receipt — never trusted from YAML: no receipt, or a
non-matching one, resolves `proposed`; a matching receipt resolves its
decision; a rejection never resolves `approved`; editing any blueprint or
manifest byte after approval reverts resolution to `proposed`. `applied` and
`superseded` require `.waaseyaa/generated.json` evidence and are #2787's
initializer/doctor extension, not part of this resolver.

## Initialization

### Canonical fresh-project lifecycle

A fresh project reaches a valid, verifiable state through exactly five ordered
phases, and consumer-facing documentation names no other sequence (#2644):

1. **create** — `composer create-project waaseyaa/waaseyaa`;
2. **site contract** — `waaseyaa site:init`, which produces `.waaseyaa/site.yaml`,
   the governed artifact set, and the generated verification command;
3. **install** — `waaseyaa install:init`, which applies the reviewed migration
   catalog, synchronizes entity storage schema, and activates the configuration
   generation;
4. **verify** — `composer site-verify`; and
5. **serve**.

`project:init` is the fresh-project convenience command for phases 2 and 3.
It executes the existing installed `site:init` and `install:init` commands in
that order, preserving their separate boot modes and semantic authorities.
Its `--dry-run` previews only phase 2; a failed site phase prevents phase 3.
It does not perform phase 4, upgrades, or generated-state verification/removal.
The command and process contract is recorded in `FW-PROJECT-INITIALIZER-01`
and the CLI kernel specification.

`install:init` is the single materialization step. It subsumes `migrate` and
`schema:sync`, and it is the only one of the three that also activates the
configuration generation, so a site materialized by `db:init` plus `migrate`
passes verification while being an invalid installation. It is idempotent, so it
is re-run after any later `site:init`. `db:init` is a database-administration
command and is not part of this lifecycle.

`site:init` precedes `install:init` because recipe-declared entity types must
exist before schema synchronization runs. Because the phases are ordered,
verification before phase 2 is a definite state rather than an error: the
verification entry reports that the project is not initialized and names
`site:init`, and it does so without booting the kernel.

`waaseyaa site:init` is both interactive and automation-safe. Interactive mode
asks product questions in plain language. Non-interactive mode accepts a
complete answer document and refuses omitted required decisions.

Initialization is transactional:

1. validate and render the proposed manifest into one immutable in-memory plan;
2. inspect existing state without staging artifacts (dry-run stops at evaluation);
3. for a live invocation, acquire the existing project lock and recover any prior transaction;
4. evaluate through the shared unit authority and request confirmation;
5. verify the reviewed plan and state identities again through controlled apply; and
6. stage and publish through the existing durable journal, installing
   `.waaseyaa/generated.json` last and marking the journal committed only after
   every target is durable.

Steps 5 and 6 are also reachable on their own, in a later process. `waaseyaa
site:apply --request=PATH [--decision-receipt=PATH]` (#2789) decodes a canonical
`waaseyaa.artifact_apply_request` v1 document — the reviewed plan with its
bytes, `plan_digest` and `project_state_digest` — and executes exactly those
bytes through the same controlled apply. The separate `--decision-receipt`
input carries the approved blueprint decision with the same closed
`SITE050`/read-once contract as `site:init`; it is not embedded in the apply
request and is passed to the execution authority as its own argument. It compiles nothing, so a generator
that names its target from a compile-time clock reading cannot produce a
second, equally valid plan the operator never reviewed. Decoding is fail-closed
on unknown, missing, duplicate or wrong-typed members, on an invalid nested
plan, and on bytes that are not the canonical serialization of the document
they decode to; refusals carry the shared `SITE0xx` codes and their JSON
Pointer, before any lock, journal or write exists. The two digests stay the
execution authority's `GEN005` check under its lock, so a request binds exactly
one reviewed state: replaying an already-published request is refused, while
re-evaluating the same plan against the state it will meet reports no changes.
Like `site:init` and `site:doctor`, the command runs on the boot-free seam and
opens no database. See [cli-kernel.md](cli-kernel.md) "Reviewed apply".

The control-ignore artifact is part of this transaction. A fresh cancellation
or successful rollback leaves no `.waaseyaa/.gitignore`; only the lock/control
directory may remain. This avoids changing a reviewed target before the stale
check. Successful default output preserves the historical count (which omitted
that bootstrap file), while structured `result.changed` reports every actual
published path, including control-ignore, metadata, Composer and retirements.
Per-artifact `status` still describes only the plan's artifact paths.

Host portability is explicit rather than assumed (#2644). `SiteHostPlatform` is
injected into the initializer and declares three capabilities the transaction
depends on, each of which the framework previously took for granted:

| Capability | POSIX | Windows | Consequence when absent |
|---|---|---|---|
| synchronize a directory handle | yes | no | the durability guarantee narrows to process death, not host death |
| enforce permission bits | yes | no | modes are declared, never compared |
| hard-link counts | yes | no | the aliasing clause of the private-file check is not enforced; the symlink and regular-file clauses still are |

On a host without directory synchronization the journal, the lock, and the
write-then-rename ordering are unchanged, so the transaction remains atomic and
recoverable across process death; only host-crash durability is POSIX-only. The
capability is injected rather than read inline from `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` so the
non-POSIX branch is exercised by the ordinary test suite on a Linux runner — an
untestable platform branch would be a claim rather than a proof — and the tests
assert that both hosts publish a byte-identical artifact set.

Existing unrecognized files are never overwritten. Re-running the same inputs
is byte-identical. An ordinary publication failure rolls back every governed
target before returning. If the process or host stops mid-publication, the
next initializer run recovers the journal to the exact prior generation before
starting new work. A cleanup failure after the durable commit cannot
reinterpret the new generation as failed or roll it back.

Generator evolution is explicit. Existing files are validated against the
digests recorded by the generator that created them, and the current renderer is
never used to pretend that historical output was produced by a newer version.
The two kinds of change are not equally recoverable, and the difference is
load-bearing (#2644):

- **A changed artifact set** is compared outside the manifest-digest guard.
  ADR-025 D-2.3a admits one named successor-plan exception:
  the managed root `site` binding using `SiteArtifactRenderer` may declare
  `set_evolution: additive`. It reports sorted additions and no drops; every
  added path still faces the existing ownership, containment and collision
  checks, while carried paths retain managed-byte and extension checks. Other
  bindings remain frozen. Frozen additions refuse `GEN011`, frozen drops
  `GEN009`, and additive drops or ineligible declarations `GEN011`. The future
  blueprint binding is not admitted. `site:init` uses this managed root
  successor path; other commands require their own reviewed migrations.
- **Changed managed bytes** of an existing artifact refuse only while the
  manifest digest is unchanged, because that is the case regeneration cannot
  distinguish from a substitution. Rebinding
  `framework.observed_lock_sha256` to the reviewed dependency lock changes the
  manifest digest, which is exactly the signal that the change is an upgrade,
  and regeneration then proceeds. That rebind is the sanctioned path, and the
  refusal message names it.

There is no generator-version migration engine. `generator_version` is read from
the project's own manifest and the framework has no way to raise it, so the
version-mismatch branch cannot fire on a framework upgrade; the manifest rebind
is what carries a project across a renderer change.

### Skeleton layout: minimal and bootable, no placeholder directories

`skeleton/` — what phase 1 (`create`) copies into a fresh project — ships only
what a fresh application needs to boot: `public/index.php`, `src/Http/
BootFailureResponder.php`, `src/Provider/AppServiceProvider.php`, the
`config/*.php` bundle, `templates/*.twig`, and `tests/Unit/`, which already
holds a real test. It ships **no placeholder directories** — no directory
whose only committed content is a `.gitkeep` (ADR-024, #2438).

Optional architectural areas — `src/Access/`, `src/Controller/`,
`src/Domain/`, `src/Entity/`, `src/Ingestion/`, `src/Search/`, `src/Seed/`,
`src/Support/`, `migrations/`, `tests/Integration/` — are created **only**
through deterministic generators: a directory appears the moment something
writes a real file into it, never as an empty scaffold, and that creation
reuses the same machinery this section already documents for `site:init`
recipes (`ensureTargetDirectory()`, collision checks, `SitePathContainment`,
the transaction journal) or, for `make:*` handlers that write files at all
(`make:content-type`, `make:public`, `make:migration`,
`make:storage-migration`), each handler's own `is_dir() || mkdir(…,
recursive: true)` guard immediately ahead of the write. Neither mechanism is
new; removing the placeholder directories changed nothing about either one,
because neither ever read or required the target directory to pre-exist.
`storage/` and the configured `files_dir` follow the identical shape one
layer down, outside `site:init` entirely: `db:init` and
`Waaseyaa\Media\LocalFileRepository` each create their own parent directory
on first write.

### Init-time presets

`site:init --preset=minimal|editorial` (#2442) is a shortcut between a plain,
capability-declining site and a fuller one with governed visual authoring
enabled. Per ADR-024 D-3/D-4, a preset is an **init-time preset, not a
durable runtime profile flag**: `SitePresetResolver` resolves the choice once,
the same moment `SiteManifestWizard` already resolves every other product
decision through one-time answers, into an ordinary `waaseyaa.site` answer
document that runs through the exact same `SiteManifestParser` →
`SiteArtifactRendererFactory` → `SiteInitializationService` pipeline a
hand-written `--answers` document does. Nothing reads "which preset produced
this site" after `site:init` has run, because nothing is asked to: `--preset`
never reaches `.waaseyaa/site.yaml` or `.waaseyaa/generated.json`.
Correspondingly, what persists in the manifest is the **resolved decisions**,
never a preset name: capability states, content types and routes,
personal-data stores, and selected recipe digests, exactly as the Capability
manifest section above already defines. `SiteManifestSchema` has no
`preset`/`profile` field, and none is added by resolving one — a preset
resolves to the same manifest shape any other init-time answer set does.

Both presets start from the same published skeleton and package cohort, and
neither publishes backend auth/security implementation code — a preset only
selects among the existing recipes described under "Recipe contract" below,
never generates code of its own:

- `minimal` activates only the `published_content` capability/recipe;
  `governed_authoring` and `subscription` both resolve `not_needed`, with the
  exact reason text `SiteManifestWizard` records for the equivalent "no"
  answer. This is the smaller preset — no `page-builder`, `admin-surface`, or
  `publishing` package is required, and no page-builder or subscriber
  artifact is generated.
- `editorial` additionally activates `governed_authoring` — the existing
  governed-authoring recipe under "Recipe contract" below, unchanged — so the
  capability state, the recipe digest, and that recipe's generated artifacts
  are published and reviewable in version control. `subscription` still
  resolves `not_needed`: personal-data collection is an orthogonal decision a
  preset does not make on an operator's behalf.

**What a preset does not do.** A preset selects capabilities and recipes and
publishes their artifacts; it does not create a separate activation mechanism.
The supported skeleton already installs the governed-authoring packages through
its `waaseyaa/framework` dependency. Provider activation uses ADR-025 D-15's
typed root-plan registration: each selected first-party recipe contributes its
fixed provider to the existing `ArtifactPlan`, and the generation transaction
merges that registration into literal root `composer.json` exactly once.
Generated fragment metadata remains compatibility output and is not a second
provider-discovery authority.

Both `--answers` (a `waaseyaa.site-seed` document, not a complete manifest,
when combined with `--preset`) and interactive mode (fewer questions — no
governed-authoring or personal-data prompts, since the preset already answered
them) resolve through `SitePresetResolver` before manifest parsing. Re-running `site:init` with the same preset and the same seed is
byte-identical and reports the exact proposed diff before changing an
already-initialized site, through the unchanged `SiteInitializationService`
dry-run/collision/journal machinery this section already documents above —
a preset introduces no second transaction, execution, or ownership authority.

#### The `waaseyaa.site-seed` document

`--preset` plus `--answers` is a **second authored input**, so it is closed and
versioned for the same reason `waaseyaa.site` is: an unknown, duplicated, or
ill-typed key is an operator decision, and silently discarding one while
`site:init` reports success is precisely the failure the manifest schema
exists to prevent. `Waaseyaa\SiteContract\Seed\SiteSeedParser` reads it:

```yaml
schema: waaseyaa.site-seed
version: 1
application:
  id: example
  name: Example
  canonical_origin:
    config_key: APP_ORIGIN
content_types:
  - id: page
    canonical_route: /{slug}
```

All four root keys are required and no other key is accepted, at any depth.
`schema` and `version` are exact: a foreign `schema` fails
`SITE014_INVALID_VALUE` and any version but `1` fails
`SITE003_UNSUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION`, so a document written for a future seed
shape is refused rather than partially honoured. Content types keep their
authored order (which is the order of the resolved capability's
`public_routes`), and duplicate identities and duplicate canonical routes are
rejected exactly as the manifest rejects them.

This is **not** a second validation authority. The seed parser reuses the same
`ManifestShapeReader` closed-shape readers `SiteManifestParser` and
`ApplicationBlueprintParser` use — same `SITE0xx` codes, same JSON Pointer
construction, same reject-unknown-then-require-then-type order — and the
application-identity and content-type sections are read by one shared
implementation for both documents, so what a canonical route or an application
identity may be cannot drift between them. There is no separate JSON-Schema
mirror the way `SiteManifestSchema` has one: a seed is an input to `site:init`
and never a generated artifact a consumer's tooling validates. The resolved
manifest still passes through `SiteManifestParser` unchanged, so the published
contract has exactly one validation authority as before.

Existing applications are never migrated to the newer, smaller skeleton
layout. No upgrade path — in particular `project:init --upgrade` (#2664) —
treats an application generated under an earlier skeleton as drifted merely
because the current skeleton no longer ships a directory that application
still has, or never had.

## Recipe contract

A recipe is a versioned first-party generator with four parts:

1. a manifest fragment and validation rules;
2. generated application composition using supported extension points;
3. architecture assertions that prohibit competing authorities; and
4. acceptance tests proving externally observable behavior.

Recipes may generate application code and configuration, but must not create a
private framework fork or duplicate framework-owned services.

**Provider activation is fixed by ADR-025 D-15 (#2857).** The supported
skeleton requires `waaseyaa/framework`, whose production dependency graph
already installs `waaseyaa/admin-surface`, `waaseyaa/page-builder`, and
`waaseyaa/publishing` before `site:init`. The identical `^0.1` requirements in
`composer.governed-authoring-recipe.json` are therefore redundant compatibility
output on this topology. They do not justify a Composer rerun or prove a
package-activation mechanism. The published-content and subscription fragments
contain provider metadata only.

Provider discovery intentionally reads literal root `composer.json`, so each
enabled recipe must instead contribute its fixed provider as a typed D-6.6
registration in the root `ArtifactPlan`. The existing generation transaction
merges that registration into the literal file. Generated fragments remain
governed artifacts for byte compatibility and drift detection, but their
`extra.waaseyaa.providers` values are not a second discovery authority.

A generated provider's entity and bundle field declarations belong to
`register()`, which the definition-only `install:init` bootstrap executes before
schema synchronization. A later ordinary `boot()` hook cannot be the first
authority to declare storage that installation must already have materialized.

At repository revision `a4bdd9167d36587fbda5853fd4b7f6c19672158b`, the
fragments and installed dependencies exist but typed recipe registrations do
not; #2857 implements the provider-plan seam before consumer documentation may
claim an activated recipe. A future thinner skeleton and its package
materialization lifecycle require the separate product and ADR decision in
D-15.4; this contract names no such consumer today.

### Published content

The first published-content recipe generates:

- bundle and field definitions;
- a registered `ListingDefinition` for pageable indexes;
- canonical detail and index routes through Path/routing authorities;
- sitemap contribution using the same canonical route resolver;
- title, description, canonical metadata, and JSON-LD integration;
- container-registered application services;
- index and detail templates; and
- access-aware listing, pagination, route, sitemap, and metadata tests.

Internal entity paths such as `/node/{id}` cannot enter the public sitemap when
a canonical application route is declared.

### Subscription

The first subscription recipe generates:

- framework-managed private storage and a tracked migration;
- container-registered repository/service boundaries;
- input validation and normalized identifiers;
- consent evidence and privacy classification;
- unsubscribe and retention/deletion lifecycle operations;
- Mail and Queue integration points that remain disabled until unsubscribe is
  proven; and
- tests showing that subscriber records and secrets are not publicly exposed.

The recipe never constructs raw PDO, performs runtime DDL, or sends mail merely
because the package is installed.

### Governed visual authoring

The governed-authoring recipe composes the existing `waaseyaa/page-builder`
capability rather than generating a site-specific builder. It generates:

- the layout field on the declared revisionable page bundle;
- an application-owned, versioned block/layout/template registry;
- semantic public renderers bound to application design tokens;
- one authenticated page-builder surface, exact-revision preview route, and
  ordinary revision/workflow persistence path;
- a page-scoped publishing composition over the canonical `node` repository,
  database, audit, entity-access, and publication-transition authorities;
- the generic Waaseyaa Admin SPA client and, when selected, an Anokii module
  adapter that opens the same drafts and builder workspace;
- role-scoped content inventory actions for pages and typed high-volume
  Updates, Events, Jobs, and Announcements; and
- parity, keyboard, accessibility, concurrency, preview, history, and
  restore-as-new-draft acceptance tests.

Drupal Canvas and Drupal core are the architecture benchmark for typed
content, governed components, media, revisions, moderation, and permissions.
Lovable is the interaction benchmark for direct selection against the real
preview, immediate feedback, responsive previews, and design-system
constraints. Neither product is a dependency or runtime authority.

Free-form HTML, CSS, JavaScript, arbitrary class names, and client-owned save
paths are not generated. A draft saved from Admin SPA must open byte-identically
from Anokii and vice versa.

## Strict diagnostics

`waaseyaa site:doctor --strict` emits a versioned machine-readable report and a
human summary. Exit zero means all required checks passed. Warnings can never
produce an `OK` summary in strict mode.

The doctor is read-only in the literal sense: it inspects the filesystem, never
boots the kernel, and never opens or creates the application database. This is a
governed invariant, not an incidental property of the current checks (#2644).
`ConsoleKernel` runs `site:doctor` through its boot-free command seam for that
reason — ordinary console boot materializes the database before any
restricted-discovery guard, so a booting doctor would create the zero-table
SQLite file it is meant to report on, and would diagnose a missing site contract
as an inactive configuration generation. A future check that needs kernel state
belongs in a different command.

The doctor validates:

- manifest schema and internal references;
- active recipe/provider/configuration wiring;
- generated artifact digests and approved extension regions;
- framework and Composer provenance policy;
- canonical-origin configuration and route ownership;
- CI adapter presence when the manifest declares a production application;
- privacy lifecycle completeness for every personal-data store;
- sitemap canonicality and public resolution; and
- every architecture rule below.

Machine findings have stable identifiers, severity, exact file/line evidence,
and remediation text. Suppressions are versioned, scoped to one exact finding
and source digest, justified, expiring, and rejected when unused.

## Architecture rules

Discovery is repo-wide over shipped application source and configuration, not a
hand-selected path list. Every candidate occurrence is classified exactly once
by verifier-owned taxonomy. At minimum strict mode rejects:

- raw `PDO` or `SQLite3` construction outside declared framework/offline test
  authorities;
- runtime DDL such as `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, or `DROP TABLE`;
- repositories, stores, or controllers constructed in route registration;
- `$_SERVER`-derived canonical URLs;
- hardcoded production origins outside typed configuration;
- manual in-memory sorting or pagination for a declared Listing;
- active delivery for a personal-data subscription without unsubscribe;
- sitemap URLs that disagree with declared canonical public routes; and
- missing or substituted generated artifacts.

The scanner must be substitution-resistant: its query universe, taxonomy,
required mappings, and finding semantics are owned by executable framework
code and tested with count-preserving valid-class substitutions as well as
omissions.

## Generated verification

Verification has two layers. `bin/maintenance/site-verify` is *generated* by
`site:init` and does the proving. `.ci/site-verify.php` is *committed* by the
skeleton, is the entry point every adapter invokes, and exists because the
generated command does not exist until phase 2 of the lifecycle.

The committed entry is plain PHP, loads no autoloader, and boots no kernel, so
it answers correctly before `composer install` and before `site:init`. It exits
3 naming `site:init` when there is no site contract, 2 when dependencies are
absent, and otherwise delegates to the generated command through `PHP_BINARY`
and returns its status. Composer invokes it as `@php .ci/site-verify.php` so
that it runs on native Windows, where Composer cannot execute a shebang script
at all; the POSIX `.ci/site-verify` shell script execs the same file, so the
pre-init instruction cannot differ between invocation paths (#2644).

`bin/maintenance/site-verify` runs without network access after dependencies
are installed. It is itself portable PHP: it re-executes the doctor and each
acceptance test through `escapeshellarg(PHP_BINARY)` rather than relying on a
child shebang. It proves:

- manifest validation and generated-artifact integrity;
- architecture rules;
- strict doctor semantics;
- listing ordering, pagination, and access filtering;
- absolute canonical sitemap URLs with no internal-path leakage;
- SEO metadata and structured data;
- declared form validation and storage boundaries;
- unsubscribe before any delivery can be enabled; and
- wiring continuity after a framework dependency update.

A production manifest may require a CI adapter, but generated CI contains only
calls to this provider-neutral command. The initial skeleton may ship a GitHub
Actions adapter because the framework currently uses GitHub; equivalent
Forgejo/Gitea/GitLab/local runners remain conforming when they execute the same
command and preserve its evidence.

## Evidence and provenance

Verification emits a canonical JSON report binding manifest digest, generator
version, framework revision, Composer lock digest, source tree identity,
artifact digests, finding set, test commands, and result. It contains no secret
values. A forge check is useful delivery evidence but does not replace this
portable report.

## Work packages

1. **WP1, contract:** schema, typed manifest model, deterministic parser,
   validator, and migration policy.
2. **WP2, initialization:** transactional `site:init`, collision handling,
   deterministic regeneration, and generated repository instructions.
3. **WP3, doctor:** strict report semantics, complete architecture discovery,
   suppression contract, and provider-neutral verification entry point.
4. **WP4, published content:** complete Listing/Path/SEO recipe and generated
   acceptance tests.
5. **WP5, subscription:** private storage/migration/privacy/Mail/Queue recipe
   and generated acceptance tests.
6. **WP6, governed authoring:** page-builder composition, Admin SPA and optional
   Anokii client parity, exact-theme preview, and generated role-based tests.
7. **WP7, reference consumer:** clean create-project fixture, offline
   regeneration, strict verification, upgrade continuity, and CI adapters.

Each work package is one issue-traceable PR with a red boundary test before
implementation. No work package may weaken strict mode to make a fixture pass.

## Acceptance gates

- A fresh application can initialize interactively or from a complete answer
  document and receives a versioned valid manifest.
- Repeated initialization is byte-identical; partial failure leaves the target
  unchanged.
- Published-content and subscription recipes generate complete supported
  integrations and their acceptance suites.
- Governed authoring generates one shared page authority. Admin SPA and an
  enabled Anokii adapter open the same draft, preview revision, history, and
  workflow path; removing either client leaves the content model unchanged.
- A communications role can create, find, duplicate, edit, preview, revise,
  and publish pages, updates, events, jobs, and announcements without raw HTML
  or developer intervention.
- An agent following only generated `AGENTS.md` uses Listings for a pageable
  index and cannot pass strict verification after substituting raw PDO/runtime
  DDL or an internal sitemap route.
- Strict diagnostics return non-zero for missing provenance, inconsistent
  capability wiring, prohibited architecture, stale generated artifacts, and
  incomplete privacy lifecycle operations.
- A clean consumer proves create-project through provider-neutral production
  preflight without contacting or depending on a forge at runtime.

## Non-goals

- enabling every installed package;
- guessing application product decisions;
- generating unrestricted free-form application code;
- making GitHub or any hosted service a runtime authority;
- replacing application-specific design and content decisions; or
- treating documentation, passing unit tests, or a green forge badge alone as
  proof of convergence.
## Runnable generated applications

For an application blueprint that emits configuration, filesystem publication
alone is not a runnable completion state. After one-time operator trust and
signing-custody provisioning, orchestration may first obtain a canonical
authorization from `project:config:authorize`, then call
`project:init --config-authorization=... --json`. The returned version 2
result is complete only after site publication, installation, and signed
configuration activation all succeed or an exact committed retry reconciles.
Missing trust, changed sync bytes, stale authorization, a different evaluated
site identity, or a non-genesis active application must refuse.

The consumer's one-time bootstrap configuration includes the authoring key's
public trust entry and selects `<project-root>/config/sync` as its authority
sync path. Signing custody remains on the authoring host. Subsequent runs need
only the answer document, its exact approval receipt, and the public signed
authorization; they do not copy generated sync files or invoke a separate
sign/import operator sequence.
