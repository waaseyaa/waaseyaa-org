# S1 SQLite topology contract

Status: implementation candidate  
Contract version: `s1-sqlite-v1`  
Change record: `S1-FW-DB-01` (`F-DB-001`, `F-DB-002`)

## Purpose

S1 certifies one deliberately small persistence topology. Dependency
abstractions and locally portable SQL do not certify another database engine,
filesystem, or deployment shape. The machine authority is
`support/s1-sqlite-v1.json`; prose and code may narrow it but may not widen it.

## Certified topology

- Exactly one application node owns exactly one authoritative SQLite database
  file.
- The authoritative file is on a local, non-network filesystem. The supported
  consumer point is ext4. A deployment preflight must verify the actual mount;
  path spelling alone cannot establish that a POSIX path is local.
- File-backed connections use WAL, enable foreign-key enforcement, and use a
  bounded `5000` millisecond busy timeout. Startup verifies the effective value
  of every PRAGMA on every new connection and refuses a mismatch.
- `:memory:` is permitted only for the explicit `local`, `dev`, `development`,
  and `testing` environments. Production, staging, empty, misspelled, and
  unknown environments refuse it before filesystem, lock, or connection work.
- At most one additional local SQLite file may hold the search projection. It
  is non-authoritative, has the same connection invariants, and is disposable
  only when a deterministic reindex from the authoritative database succeeds.
- The S1 serving envelope is one application node. Multiple local PHP-FPM
  workers may share its one SQLite file subject to the later concurrency,
  migration-lock, and scheduler-fencing contracts; this package does not claim
  those later guarantees are already implemented.

## Refusal boundary

Configuration that looks like a URI or DSN is not interpreted as a filename.
`mysql:`, `pgsql:`, `postgresql:`, `sqlite:`, `file:`, URI authority forms, and
other schemes fail with a stable topology diagnostic. Windows UNC/device paths
and slash-form network shares fail. MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, replication,
database failover, shared/network filesystems, horizontal application scaling,
and H1 are unsupported.

An ordinary absolute local Windows drive path remains a valid library input for
local development. It is not part of the certified Linux consumer point.

## Authority and verification

`DBALDatabase::createSqlite()` is the common connection boundary for the
authoritative database and optional search projection. It validates path shape,
establishes the PRAGMAs, then reads them back. A DBAL driver middleware repeats
that configuration and verification on every physical reconnect. Kernel,
search, `db:init`, and migration entry points pass the resolved environment to
the same fail-closed authority; `DatabaseBootstrapper` owns application-database
directory preparation and the production missing-file guard.

The repository checker binds the JSON contract to runtime constants,
documentation, package composition, reproducible verification commands, and a
repository-wide occurrence roster for DBAL factories/wrappers, raw PDO/SQLite3
constructors, driver tokens, and SQLite DSNs. Every occurrence is classified as
a serving authority/entry point, offline artifact authority, inherited
migration wrapper, runtime capability configuration, test utility, test, or
tooling query; omission, invention, or valid-class substitution fails.
Roster entries bind semantic identity (path, pattern, class, normalized match
hash, occurrence index) — never line numbers or file hashes — so unrelated
edits in rostered files cannot invalidate the roster (schema v2, see
[governed-gates.md](governed-gates.md) §6).
The installed-artifact proof seals the exact candidate database package,
extracts it into an isolated consumer `vendor` boundary without a Composer path
repository, proves that the runtime class loaded from that artifact, and then
repeats the effective-PRAGMA, reconnect, environment, and refused-path
assertions. Its isolated Doctrine/PSR dependencies must match the root lock and
installed metadata, are recursively byte-digested after copying, and produce a
canonical dependency-manifest digest. It is offline-capable and does not
substitute a previously published package for the candidate.
GitHub Actions may execute those commands, but neither GitHub nor any other
forge is a contract or evidence authority.

## Explicit non-claims

WAL is not replication, high availability, or a substitute for backup. The
optional search projection is not a second source of truth. This contract does
not close schema authority, optimistic concurrency, scheduler fencing, backup,
restore, or disaster-recovery findings owned by later packages.
