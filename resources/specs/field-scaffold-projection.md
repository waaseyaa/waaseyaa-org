# Canonical field scaffold projection

Change record: `docs/change-records/FW-FIELD-PROJECTION-01.md` (#2847).

## Purpose

Field declarations emitted by manual scaffolds must derive their admissible
type ids, PHP property types, defaults, entity-value shape, and storage shape
from the registered field authority. A generator must not carry a second
field-type-id map.

## Authority and projection

`Waaseyaa\Field\FieldScaffoldProjection` is the internal field-package adapter
for PHP scaffold emitters. It consumes one
`FieldTypeManagerInterface&FieldValueKindResolverInterface` and:

- admits registered blueprint-capable field types whose default settings are
  complete;
- additionally admits registered entity-reference value kinds for authored
  manual references;
- validates every projected definition through `FieldSchemaAuthority` and the
  plugin-owned entity storage projection;
- selects a scalar PHP representation from `FieldValueKind`, retaining it only
  when `FieldTypeInferrer::isCompatible()` permits the explicit field id;
- falls back to `mixed = null` when a registered field has no compatible
  scalar declaration; and
- projects multiple-value definitions as `array = []`.

Unknown ids and registered types lacking required declaration metadata fail
closed. The adapter has no field-type-id allowlist and does not widen
`FieldTypeInterface`.

## Manual and blueprint semantics

For equivalent scalar declarations, manual `make:content-type` and blueprint
entity emission use the same property representation. In particular:

- `text` projects as `string = ''`; and
- `datetime` projects as `mixed = null`, because a scalar `string` declaration
  is not compatible with the explicit `datetime` field id.

The blueprint emitter and its golden artifacts are unchanged by this slice.

Entity references are intentionally not equivalent inputs. A manual author may
write `field:entity_reference:target`; the generated `#[Field]` keeps
`settings.target_entity_type_id`. A blueprint author declares a relationship,
which synthesizes the reference field and also emits relationship-registry
metadata such as cardinality, requiredness, and deletion behavior. The scalar
blueprint vocabulary therefore continues to exclude `entity_reference`.

## Integration boundary

The real command must receive the kernel's boot-scoped registered manager so
downstream field plugins participate without a generator edit. The command
provider wiring is required acceptance for this slice; it cannot be deferred
while a production path silently selects the built-ins-only static registry.
Missing or incompatible registry services must refuse rather than narrow the
registered vocabulary. A discriminating provider-composition test must exercise
a downstream plugin through the actual command registration path.

Standalone constructors require an explicit non-null projection dependency;
moving the static fallback to another helper is not registry injection. The
remaining packaged create/read/update acceptance for #2847 stays separately
tracked. Blueprint compiler/emitter, shared golden fixtures, generation engine
and public-surface aggregates remain outside this repair.

## Rendering and label custody

Registry admission does not make a type id safe to interpolate as a PHP literal.
Emit registered ids with PHP literal escaping and preserve their exact value.
The manual label key remains the first authored `string` field, falling back to
the first field; changing a field's PHP representation must not change that key.
