# S1 OIDC signing-key lifecycle

Status: implementation contract for the signing-key lifecycle slice of
`S1-FW-CFG-04`.

This is a forge-neutral local contract. It authorizes synthetic tests and local
source changes only; it does not authorize access to operational signing
material, publication, deployment, production mutation, or a rotation ceremony.

## Authority and states

One migration-backed OIDC lifecycle owns four exact states:
`staged-verify-only`, `active-sign-and-verify`,
`retired-verify-only`, and `revoked`. At most one active key and one staged
successor may exist. A monotonic database sequence allocates key versions; a
version is never derived from key bytes and is never reused by a committed key.

Reads perform no generation, rotation, repair, or DDL. An empty production
lifecycle refuses signing and JWKS service until an explicitly confirmed
initialization command establishes the first active key. Compatibility PEM
loaders remain available to explicit callers, but issuer signing and JWKS
composition always use the database lifecycle.

## Custody and algorithms

Public `SigningKey` metadata contains no private value. Private PEM crosses
from encrypted persistence into a process-local `SecretHandle` and only the
registered RS256 signing consumer can turn it into signature bytes. Signer
handles refuse serialization and expose only redacted metadata. A closed
algorithm policy applies at configuration ingestion, minting, and JWKS
construction.

## Ordinary rotation

Ordinary rotation is a three-phase protocol:

1. `stageSuccessor` transactionally allocates a version and publishes one
   verify-only public key without changing the active signer.
2. `recordPropagation` binds a SHA-256 digest of non-secret observable
   propagation evidence to that staged key.
3. `activateSuccessor` waits through the published JWKS cache lifetime plus
   propagation margin, then one transaction compare-and-swaps the expected
   active version to retired and the staged key to active.

The predecessor receives:

`retain_until = rotated_at + maximum configured token lifetime + maximum clock
skew + JWKS cache lifetime + propagation margin`.

Cleanup can delete only ordinary retired keys whose full boundary has elapsed.
JWKS publishes the staged successor, active signer, and every unexpired retired
verifier; it never publishes revoked or private material. Its cache max-age is
read from the same lifecycle policy used in retention arithmetic. This ensures
the first post-activation token verifies against the oldest cache permitted by
the pre-activation policy.

## Compromise boundary

Emergency revocation is not ordinary rotation. It is a separately confirmed,
request-identified mutation that records actor, reason, affected persisted
access/refresh-token enumeration digests and counts, and the conservative
stateless issuance window. Revoked keys leave signing and JWKS trust
immediately. External key destruction and any operational invalidation remain
deployment/operator responsibilities.

## Configuration-manifest trust composition

CFG-03 envelope signing is composed only by the configuration authority
provider. Every profile receives a closed Ed25519 verifier. A profile receives
a signer only when bootstrap configuration supplies an exact trusted public key
reference and an exact non-secret secret-provider reference:

```php
'config_manifest_signing' => [
    'trust_keys' => [
        'cfg04:manifest-key-v1' => [
            'algorithm' => 'Ed25519',
            'public_key' => '<canonical-base64-32-byte-public-key>',
        ],
    ],
    'revoked_trust_keys' => [],
    'signing_key' => [
        'trust_key_reference' => 'cfg04:manifest-key-v1',
        'secret_reference' => [
            'provider' => '<registered-provider-id>',
            'identifier' => '<opaque-provider-reference>',
            'secret_class' => 'token-signing-private-key',
            'purpose' => 'waaseyaa.config.manifest-signing.v1',
        ],
    ],
],
```

The provider registers that exact package, class, purpose, provider, and the
resolver registry's canonical environment tuple before the kernel freezes the
registry. It never accepts private material in configuration. Signing resolves
one provider version into a non-exporting handle operation and derives its
Ed25519 public key before signing; a rotated or stale private version that does
not match the public key bound to the trust reference fails closed. Diagnostic
and serialization surfaces cannot expose the provider identifier or private
bytes. Verification
accepts only the envelope's exact Ed25519 algorithm and trust reference, and a
revoked, unknown, malformed, or tampered envelope fails closed. A verifier-only
profile requires no signing provider and publishes no signing authority. This
slice published the CFG-03 interface bindings only; the operational signing
command arrived with #2430 as `config:manifest:sign`
(`Waaseyaa\Config\Manifest\ConfigManifestBundleSigner`). Key ceremony —
generation, distribution, rotation scheduling — remains out of scope here and is
governed by the sections above. The command consumes custody; it never creates
it, and it refuses outright on a profile that composes no signer. Its result
object (`ConfigManifestSigningResult`) carries only public evidence: envelope
path, manifest hash, scope, sequence, trust-key reference, and the required
contract cohort. No provider identifier and no private bytes appear on it or on
any surface derived from it.

**Where the two profiles physically sit (#2430).** The signer profile belongs on
an authoring host — a maintainer machine or a protected CI environment — and the
verifier-only profile is what a consumer runs. A consumer receives the authored
sync directory, the signed envelope beside it
(`Waaseyaa\Config\Manifest\ConfigManifestEnvelopeFile`, so `config/sync` is
authorized by `config/sync.envelope.json`), and the public `trust_keys`; it never
receives the signing key. The signing secret must never be exposed to
pull-request workflows or to ordinary production runtime. Moving the envelope
between hosts moves no custody: the sidecar carries only signed public bytes, and
reading it grants nothing until the verifier checks it against a trusted key.

`project:config:authorize` uses this same authoring-host signer for fresh project
composition. It renders the canonical plan and exact generated sync bytes before
`project:init`, then emits a public authorization whose signed producer evidence
binds the site manifest digest, plan digest, and sequence-1 configuration
manifest. The generated consumer is provisioned once with the corresponding
public `trust_keys` entry and its canonical `config/sync` path through
`config.sync_path` or `WAASEYAA_CONFIG_SYNC_PATH`. It is never provisioned with
the signing secret or secret-provider reference, and it neither signs nor trusts
new caller-supplied keys during initialization. Each activation and exact retry
verifies the authorization with the existing CFG-03 trust policy.

## Schema and verification

All lifecycle columns, version authority, indexes, and append-only revocation
evidence arrive through a DB-02 migration. Runtime repositories only assert the
schema and perform DML. Retained-red proofs cover empty-read refusal,
non-exporting custody, rollback on successor failure, staged propagation,
oldest-cache verification, exact retention arithmetic, competing successors,
monotonic versions, cleanup boundaries, emergency revocation, and the CFG-03
trust-policy seam.
