# Bimaaji — Application Graph & Agent Mutation Layer

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-09-06 - #2660 Part B (implemented review candidate; ADR-026 Accepted): Codex moves to PerSkillFile delivery (.agents/skills/waaseyaa-<id>/SKILL.md plus concise root AGENTS.md), backed by a verified upstream citation on CodexClientTransformer. Claude and Codex now share the new AbstractPerSkillClientTransformer; every per-skill file and guidance index carries a source-hash provenance marker (ParsedSkill::$sourceSha256, SkillInventory::inventorySha256()) proving Claude/Codex per-skill parity. New ClientCapabilitySurface + ClientCapabilityDiagnostics give bimaaji:install a deterministic warning-severity diagnostic for an unsupported requested capability. Detail in docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md "Client capability model and skill inventory (#2660)" and docs/adr/026-client-guidance-and-skill-conventions.md. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-09-02 - #2660 Part A repair round: ClientCapabilities::$requiresFrontmatterAtByteZero was never read by production code (ClaudeClientTransformer emitted frontmatter unconditionally), so the registry held only path and prefix authority; the transformer now derives the block from the flag, with the shipped bytes unchanged. ClientCapabilities also closes its shape at construction via ClientCapabilityException (no blank ids/paths; consolidated and per-skill field sets are disjoint), and SkillInventory::fromSkills() now sorts by id and rejects duplicate ids instead of promising a canonical inventory it did not deliver. Detail in docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md "Client capability model and skill inventory (#2660 Part A)". -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-09-02 - #2660 Part A: bimaaji:install's seven client transformers now read a typed Waaseyaa\Bimaaji\Install\ClientCapabilityRegistry instead of hardcoding per-client behaviour, and BimaajiInstallCommand enumerates the canonical skill set through a new SkillInventory instead of a raw list<ParsedSkill>. Behaviour-preserving (proven by a golden-snapshot regression test); the mapping still mirrors the currently shipped convention. Detail in docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md "Client capability model and skill inventory (#2660 Part A)"; the three open conventions the registry deliberately does not decide are in docs/adr/026-client-guidance-and-skill-conventions.md. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-29 - #2656 containment review: the ownership manifest write bypassed the sandbox boundary, and the boundary resolved only the nearest existing ancestor, never the target path — so a symlinked .waaseyaa or a target-file symlink redirected writes and the pruner rewrite outside the project root. One boundary now covers every path; a manifest that cannot be persisted is a non-zero exit. Detail in docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md "Containment (NFR-002)". -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-29 - #2656 follow-up review: the Claude transformer emitted a flat .claude/skills/waaseyaa-<id>.md that Claude Code does not discover, and the Codex transformer wrote .codex/AGENTS.md which is not a discovery location at all; both corrected. Added retired-target pruning via InstalledManifest (recorded ownership, never inferred). Detail in docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-29 - #2656 packaged skill resources: Implementation Status listed M5 (bimaaji-install-command-01KS5W0S) as Deferred while packages/bimaaji/src/Install/ was fully implemented. Flipped it to Shipped and recorded the #2656 change of source-of-truth: the canonical Agent Skills moved from the monorepo root (skills/waaseyaa/) into packages/bimaaji/resources/skills/, default resolution begins at the installed package, and installation is marker-bounded. Detail lives in docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-04 - #2177 MCP enterprise hardening: Bimaaji's graph/spec provider bindings and introspection tools remain read-only discovery surfaces. Privileged graph and spec introspection is now explicitly curated and withheld from remotely reachable MCP registries unless an application grants the corresponding capability; the graph-generation contract itself is unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-22 - WP15 (alpha245 security, audit): MutationValidator runs sovereignty guardrails before structural validation; BimaajiServiceProvider wires SovereigntyGuardrails into the live validator binding. Acceptance: MutationValidatorTest::it_gates_sovereignty_sensitive_operations_through_the_guardrails. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-23 - M3 WP04 (bimaaji-mcp-bridge-01KS5VS8): added "MCP exposure" subsection enumerating the five bimaaji #[AsAgentTool] adapters surfaced over MCP through AgentToolRegistryBridge. Updated Implementation Status to flip M2 + M3 from "Deferred" to "Shipped". Bound SpecIndexProvider as a container singleton in BimaajiServiceProvider (WP02). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-21 - M1 (bimaaji-wakeup-01KS5VEY) flipped Implementation Status from "scaffolding only" to "shipped". -->

## Implementation Status

**Current route-wiring contract (ROUTE-METADATA-01, #3121):** CLI `graph:dump`
and `route:list` consume the kernel's completed immutable route snapshot. The
three route section providers obtain it lazily on each inspection; construction
does not require an HTTP-only live router. Incomplete, legacy or invalidated
kernel authority refuses strict export without a routeless fallback. Explicit
bare collections remain compatible only when no kernel accessor exists. Release
publication and installed downstream qualification are tracked in the change
record; the older M1 checkpoints below are historical rather than current gaps.

**Shipped (as of M1 `bimaaji-wakeup-01KS5VEY`):**

- `BimaajiServiceProvider` is auto-discovered via `extra.waaseyaa.providers` in `packages/bimaaji/composer.json`.
- `ApplicationGraphGenerator` is bound as a container singleton, wired with the six default `GraphSectionProvider` implementations (admin, entities, jsonapi, public_surface, routing, sovereignty).
- Each default provider's constructor dependencies (`EntityTypeManagerInterface`, `RouteCollection`, `SovereigntyProfile`) resolve from the kernel-services bus. Route inspection first reads the canonical kernel snapshot; bare explicit `RouteCollection` falls back to `WaaseyaaRouter::getRouteCollection()` only when the kernel accessor is absent; `SovereigntyProfile` falls back to `SovereigntyProfile::Local`.
- `BimaajiServiceProvider` implements `HasNativeCommandsInterface` (empty stub; the `graph:dump` command lands in WP02 of M1).
- Unit test coverage at `packages/bimaaji/tests/Unit/BimaajiServiceProviderTest.php` (7 tests, 38 assertions: binding identity, tagged collection, six-section output, lazy resolution, capability interface, RouteCollection fallback).

**In progress (M1 follow-up WPs):**

- WP02 — `bin/waaseyaa graph:dump [--section=…] [--format=json|yaml] [--strict]` CLI command (FR-005, FR-006, FR-011..FR-013).
- WP03 — booted-kernel integration test under `tests/Integration/PhaseN/Bimaaji/` (FR-010, NFR-001, SC-005).
- WP05 — cross-mission gate proving M2 needs no further bimaaji wiring (verification artifact at `kitty-specs/bimaaji-wakeup-01KS5VEY/verification.md`).

**Shipped (M2 `ai-agent-bimaaji-tools-01KS5VKR`, 2026-05-22):**

- Four `#[AsAgentTool]` adapters under `packages/ai-agent/src/Tool/Bimaaji/`: `IntrospectGraphTool`, `IntrospectSectionTool`, `ProposeMutationTool`, `GeneratePatchTool`. Contract tests under `packages/ai-agent/tests/Contract/Bimaaji/`. Reference `BimaajiDemoAgent` + end-to-end agent-runtime tests prove the introspect → propose → generate flow against an in-memory SQLite kernel.
- `BimaajiServiceProvider` now binds `MutationValidator`, `PatchGenerator`, and `SovereigntyGuardrails` as container singletons (M2 WP01 follow-up).
- SC-004 surface contract pinned at `kitty-specs/ai-agent-bimaaji-tools-01KS5VKR/verification.md`.

**Shipped (M3 `bimaaji-mcp-bridge-01KS5VS8`, 2026-05-23):**

- Bimaaji surfaced over MCP via `packages/mcp/`'s new bridge architecture (`McpEndpoint` + per-request `AgentToolRegistryBridge`). See "MCP exposure" below for the tool inventory and `docs/specs/mcp-endpoint.md` § "Bimaaji MCP bridge" for the transport contract.
- New fifth bimaaji tool: `bimaaji_search_specs` (substring search over `docs/specs/*.md` via `SpecIndexProvider`).
- `SpecIndexProvider` is now container-bound singleton in `BimaajiServiceProvider`.
- M3 supersedes the 2026-05-20 PHP-only deferral that closed [#1463](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/1463).

**Shipped (M5 `bimaaji-install-command-01KS5W0S`, 2026-05-23):**

- `bin/waaseyaa bimaaji:install` — per-client guidelines/skills install command. Seven `ClientTransformerInterface` implementations under `packages/bimaaji/src/Install/Client/`; contract, flags, and trust guarantees in [docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md](bimaaji-install.md).
- The canonical Agent Skills ship as resources of this package (`packages/bimaaji/resources/skills/<id>/SKILL.md`) since #2656. They used to live at the framework monorepo root, a path no consumer has, so the command only worked in the repository that did not need it. Default resolution now begins at the installed package; `bimaaji.skills_directory` overrides it.
- Installation is marker-bounded: a re-run refreshes only the text between the `<!-- waaseyaa:bimaaji:install BEGIN -->` / `END` markers and preserves hand-authored content outside them.
- Installation is also ownership-tracked. `Waaseyaa\Bimaaji\Install\InstalledManifest` records every generated path per client in `.waaseyaa/bimaaji-install.json`, and a later run prunes targets the current skill set no longer produces. Ownership is recorded, never inferred from a filename. See [docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md](bimaaji-install.md) "Ownership and pruning retired targets".
- Every path `bimaaji:install` touches — reads, writes, deletes, neutralisations, and the ownership manifest — passes one containment boundary that rejects absolute paths and `..`, requires the nearest existing ancestor to resolve inside the project root, and rejects a target that is a link or that resolves outside it. See [docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md](bimaaji-install.md) "Containment (NFR-002)".
- Per-client target paths were re-verified against first-party vendor documentation on 2026-08-29. `claude` now writes the documented `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` directory layout and `codex` the repository-root `AGENTS.md`; both previously wrote paths their client does not read. See [docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md](bimaaji-install.md) "Convention drift".
- `Waaseyaa\Bimaaji\Install\ClientCapabilityRegistry` and `Waaseyaa\Bimaaji\Install\SkillInventory` (#2660 Part A, 2026-09-02) replace the per-transformer hardcoded target paths and the Claude-only `DIRECTORY_PREFIX` constant with one data-driven client capability model and one typed skill enumeration, without changing any generated output. Every capability field is executable: `ClaudeClientTransformer` derives its per-skill YAML frontmatter from `requiresFrontmatterAtByteZero`, `ClientCapabilities` closes its shape at construction, and `SkillInventory` sorts by id and rejects duplicates. See [docs/specs/bimaaji-install.md](bimaaji-install.md) "Client capability model and skill inventory (#2660 Part A)" and [docs/adr/026-client-guidance-and-skill-conventions.md](../adr/026-client-guidance-and-skill-conventions.md), whose accepted Part B decision resolves the three conventions Part A left open.

## Purpose

Bimaaji provides machine-readable introspection of a booted Waaseyaa application and a safe mutation protocol for AI agents. It answers: "What does this application contain, and how can an agent safely change it?"

The name comes from Anishinaabemowin *bimaaji* — "to give life to" — reflecting its role in making the application's structure visible and actionable.

## Architecture

Bimaaji sits at **Layer 5 (AI)** alongside `ai-schema`, `ai-agent`, `ai-pipeline`, and `ai-vector`. It reads from lower layers (entity system, routing, access control, admin surface) but never writes to them directly — mutations go through a validated protocol.

## Core Concepts

### Application Graph

A versioned, deterministic JSON document describing the full application structure. Built by `ApplicationGraphGenerator` from registered `GraphSectionProviderInterface` implementations.

**Key types:**
- `GraphSection` — immutable DTO: `key`, `version`, `data`
- `GraphSectionProviderInterface` — `getKey(): string`, `provide(): GraphSection`
- `ApplicationGraph` — versioned container of sections, `toArray()` serializes to JSON-safe structure
- `ApplicationGraphGenerator` — composes providers, handles failures (log+skip unless strict mode)

### Graph Sections

Each section maps a subsystem:

| Section key | Source | Provider |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| `entities` | `EntityTypeManager::getDefinitions()` | `EntityIntrospectionProvider` |
| `jsonapi` | Route collection + `ResourceSerializer` | `JsonApiIntrospectionProvider` |
| `admin` | `AbstractAdminSurfaceHost::buildCatalog()` | `AdminIntrospectionProvider` |
| `routing` | `RouteCollection` options/defaults | `RoutingIntrospectionProvider` |
| `sovereignty` | `SovereigntyProfile` enum | `SovereigntyIntrospectionProvider` |
| `public_surface` | SSR paths + auth classification | `PublicSurfaceProvider` |
| `spec_index` | `docs/specs/*` file index | `SpecIndexProvider` |

### Mutation Protocol

Request/result types for agent-safe changes. No filesystem writes — the protocol validates intent against the application graph.

- `MutationRequest` — what the agent wants to change (entity type, field, route, etc.)
- `MutationResult` — success/failure with error codes, validated against graph
- Sovereignty violations delegated to guardrail rules
- `entityType` and non-null `field` identifiers are restricted to `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`; invalid names fail validation before they can become suggested paths.

### Patch Generator

Converts accepted `MutationResult` into reviewable patches:
- PHP files: AST-safe via `nikic/php-parser`, round-trip tested
- Non-PHP: constrained operations with risk flags
- Output: file path, content hashes, diff text
- Defense in depth: `PatchGenerator` independently evaluates the same identifier allowlist and derives `PatchEntry::$unsafe` from that result. A forged successful `MutationResult` with path-breaking identifiers is therefore visibly unsafe even if it bypasses `MutationValidator`. Patch generation still never writes to disk.

### Sovereignty Guardrails

Declarative rules that disallow mutations violating the deployment posture per `SovereigntyProfile`. Integrated as mutation validators.

## Dependencies

- `waaseyaa/foundation` — `SovereigntyProfile`, `LoggerInterface`
- `waaseyaa/entity` — `EntityTypeManagerInterface`, `EntityTypeInterface`
- `waaseyaa/routing` — route collection access
- `waaseyaa/api` — `ResourceSerializer` mapping
- `waaseyaa/admin-surface` — catalog introspection
- `nikic/php-parser` — AST-safe patch generation

## Design Decisions

1. **Read-only introspection, write-only mutation** — Bimaaji never modifies application state during introspection. Mutations are separate, validated, and produce patches for human review.
2. **Non-fatal provider failures** — A broken introspection provider logs a warning and is omitted from the graph, unless strict mode is enabled.
3. **Versioned graph schema** — The top-level graph and each section carry version strings for backward compatibility.
4. **No spec bodies in graph** — `spec_index` contains file paths and metadata, not full spec content, to keep the graph compact.

## MCP exposure

Bimaaji's surface is exposed to external MCP clients (Claude Code,
Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) via five `#[AsAgentTool]` adapters living
in `packages/ai-agent/src/Tool/Bimaaji/`. `packages/mcp/`'s
`AgentToolRegistryBridge` adapts the framework-wide
`Waaseyaa\AI\Tools\ToolRegistryInterface` to MCP's
`tools/list` + `tools/call` envelope — no per-tool MCP code exists.

| Tool name | Capability | Delegates to |
|---|---|---|
| `bimaaji_introspect_graph` | `bimaaji.read` | `ApplicationGraphGenerator::generate()->toArray()` |
| `bimaaji_introspect_section` | `bimaaji.read` | `ApplicationGraphGenerator::generate()->getSection($key)` |
| `bimaaji_propose_mutation` | `bimaaji.mutate` | `MutationValidator::validate()` |
| `bimaaji_generate_patch` | `bimaaji.mutate` | `PatchGenerator::generate()` — never writes to disk |
| `bimaaji_search_specs` | `bimaaji.read` | `SpecIndexProvider` + substring search over `docs/specs/*.md` |

Capability gating runs at the tool layer:
`AbstractAgentTool::requireCapability($cap, $account)` checks
`$account->hasPermission($cap)` and returns a `forbidden` envelope on
miss. The integrating application's permission model (typically
session middleware + role/policy stack) owns capability grants.

details — see `docs/specs/mcp-endpoint.md` § "Bimaaji MCP bridge".

## Read-only agent guidance verification

`bin/waaseyaa ai:verify` checks recorded Bimaaji agent guidance using the canonical installer transformers and managed-region rules. It reports schema-1 whole-file evidence separately from current managed-region freshness, preserves human outer edits, and refuses missing, malformed, unsupported or escaping evidence. `--client` selects recorded clients; an uninstalled or unknown selection cannot succeed by checking nothing. See [Bimaaji install and verification](bimaaji-install.md) and [FW-AI-VERIFY-01](../change-records/FW-AI-VERIFY-01.md). Upgrade, update/apply, removal and Composer-hook orchestration remain separate work under #2664.


## ROUTE-METADATA-01 canonical inspection

Bimaaji route sections now receive lazy collection accessors by default, reading
the completed kernel RouteSnapshot and projecting it with RouteMetadataCompiler
on every provide(). Explicit collection constructor callers remain compatible.
Incomplete, legacy, failed or malformed kernel authority refuses without a
fallback. Final route custody is checked after all graph sections, even in soft
section mode; independent section failures retain prior behavior. JSON:API
identity reads _entity_type defaults before legacy parameter options. Graph JSON
uses writeRaw and preserves literal console markup. The kernel and bare-context
contract is defined in route-metadata.md. Installed FETDER proof remains pending.

The command rechecks route authority after JSON serialization and before writing.
Third-party JsonSerializable values may run code or catch mutation refusal;
failed final custody returns exit1 with no graph bytes in either strict or ordinary
mode. Serialization failures also return a command error without partial JSON.
