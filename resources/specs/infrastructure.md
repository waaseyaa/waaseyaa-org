<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-25 - #2122 maintenance-mode pre-boot gate: `HttpKernel::handle()` now runs `maintenanceGate()` BEFORE `boot()`. When the canonical flag file (`storage/maintenance.flag`, resolved by `MaintenanceSettings::fromEnvironment()`) reads active — via the fail-closed `MaintenanceState::read()` — the kernel returns a branded `503` + `Retry-After` from `MaintenanceModeMiddleware::maintenanceResponse()` without opening or querying the database, so maintenance survives a DB mid-swap (the SFN live-SQLite-swap incident). The gate request is built with `HttpRequest::create(server: $_SERVER)` (NOT `createFromGlobals()`), so `php://input` is never consumed and POST bodies survive for non-maintenance requests. Loopback (`REMOTE_ADDR`) and a configurable health path are exempt; the localhost exemption is disabled with `WAASEYAA_MAINTENANCE_TRUST_LOCALHOST=false` for same-host reverse-proxy topologies. `MaintenanceModeMiddleware` deliberately carries NO `#[AsMiddleware]` attribute, so `PackageManifestCompiler` never discovers it into the post-boot pipeline — single invocation path. No existing infrastructure contract surface changed; the gate is a new pre-boot short-circuit. Substantive operator surface: docs/specs/operations-playbooks.md "Playbook I" + docs/specs/middleware-pipeline.md "Pre-boot maintenance gate". Acceptance: HttpKernelMaintenanceGateTest, MaintenanceModeMiddlewareTest, MaintenanceStateTest. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-25 - #2124 ServiceProvider merge resolution root: `ServiceProvider::mergeChildProvider()` previously copied only binding definitions, leaving each provider with its own private `$resolved` singleton cache. Because a child binding closure captures the child's `$this`, `$this->resolve('A')` inside one binding forked a second instance of a `singleton`-declared service away from the one external consumers resolved against the merge root — silent split-brain at the DI seam. Merged children now delegate `resolve()` to the single merge root (transitively for nested grandchildren) via a private `$mergeRoot` link, so every resolution — including those inside the child's own binding closures — resolves against and caches in one place; a shared binding is exactly one instance across the composed stack. Pre-merge-resolved entries are adopted into the root; a genuine conflict (same abstract already resolved to a different instance) or a self-merge throws rather than forking silently. Standalone, never-merged providers are byte-for-byte unchanged (the delegation branch is inert while `$mergeRoot` is null). Audit: zero production callers — latent hardening. Acceptance: MergeChildProviderResolutionTest, KernelServicesInterfaceTest. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-19 - Sheguiandah gap batch: media upload and entity-gated download resolve the canonical top-level files_dir when legacy files_root is absent. Explicit files_root retains precedence for backward compatibility; otherwise the existing storage/files fallback remains. The media download's source_uri authority is canonical in entity-field-read-boundary.md. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-18 - #2064 WP4 persistent-worker optimization retains only bounded immutable entity-layout blueprints and bounded JSON:API structural route templates. Every layout blueprint is rebound to current registry generations; every route template is cloned into a fresh router. Their complete isolation dimensions and cache exclusions are canonical in entity-field-read-boundary.md and api-layer.md; no request/security/runtime objects are retained. -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-17 - #2064 WP2 persistent dispatch signs QueueEnvelopeV1 only with an explicit reviewed factory; default dispatch retains a non-authorizing legacy payload plus deduplicated diagnostics. QueueServiceProvider accepts reviewed envelope-factory and scoped-authority-runtime implementations only through the kernel-services bus and otherwise uses NoAuthority. Workers confine resolved authority to the handler callback and clear it before queue side effects; CLI/API persistent retry preserves the original signed envelope and queue. Queue/cache diagnostics are production-wired at first-party write boundaries; state has no repository composition root, so MemoryState/SqlState expose the diagnostic at their constructor/write boundary. ProtectedCacheDimensions covers bundle/language/revision, and PublicStateProjection is Public-only; hard rejection remains WP4. -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-14 - R21 WP7 (#2010/#2000): request-reachable mutable process statics are blocked unless tools/access-hardening-baseline.php carries a reviewed, non-empty lifetime/isolation rationale. Safe alternatives are instance state, per-request execution context, or a structural cache keyed by every isolation dimension; unsafe fixture coverage runs in composer verify and blocking CI. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-15 - issue #2049 (generic media authoring): `/api/media/upload` now accepts authenticated GET + POST under the existing `access media` permission. GET exposes only safe `max_bytes`/`allowed_mime_types` capabilities; POST requires a canonical media bundle and checks the actor's server-side media create access for that bundle before file validation or persistence. The response keeps the existing public URI/URL contract, storage failures are generic and clean up moved bytes, and no storage path or access-policy reason is returned. `MediaServiceProvider` threads the kernel's existing `EntityAccessHandler` into `MediaRouter`; no parallel authorization system or media-version/CAS activation was introduced. Acceptance: MediaRouterTest, MediaServiceProviderTest, BuiltinRouteRegistrarTest. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-14 - R21 WP6 (#2010): BuiltinRouteRegistrar adds GET /media/{id}/download with explicit allowAll transport posture so anonymous callers may reach media whose entity policy grants view. MediaDownloadRouter remains the enforcement point: it loads the media entity, requires an Allowed view decision, resolves only a contained public:// source_uri beneath files_root, and collapses missing/denied/invalid paths to 404 before streaming with nosniff. Queue failed-job retry now uses FailedJobRepositoryInterface::claimForRetry() as a conditional UPDATE on the existing retried_at column; API and CLI claim before dispatch, release on dispatch failure, and forget only after success, so concurrent same-id retries have one dispatch winner without a schema migration. -->

     (`POST /api/workflow-definitions/dry-run`, `GET /api/workflow-definitions/{workflow_id}/guards`)

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-05 - audit-remediation batch R8 WP2 (security, audit R8-c): `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Cache\DiscoveryCachePrimitives::CACHE_KEY_GENERATION` bumped 2->3. `packages/api`'s `DiscoveryRouter::handleTopicHub()`/`handleCluster()`/`handleTimeline()` gained a source-entity view gate (see docs/specs/api-layer.md "Discovery API Handler") — a response cached under generation 2 could disclose a 200 hub/cluster/timeline payload for a source the caller could not view. The bump is a pure cache-key-input change here in foundation (see "Discovery Response Caching (v1.0)" below); the gate itself lives in the api-layer package. No change to the cache bin, invalidation tags, or the public contract-version envelope (`meta.contract_version`) — `CACHE_KEY_GENERATION` is a private input to `buildKey()`'s hash, never surfaced in a response. Pinned by `DiscoveryCachePrimitivesTest::keyDiffersFromGenerationTwoShape`. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-02 - WP6 foundation layer-gate scope + Diagnostic fixes (#1855-#1863 batch): packages/foundation/tests/Unit/LayerDependencyTest.php's file-scan test previously only covered src/Http/, leaving src/Diagnostic/ (and a few other files) unchecked by the PHPUnit-level gate even though bin/check-package-layers already caught them via $kernelExemptFiles. Extended the scan to all of src/ with its own SRC_SCAN_EXEMPT_FILES allowlist mirroring $kernelExemptFiles one-for-one (see "Kernel exemption surface" below). Removed a stale $kernelExemptFiles entry (HasCommandsInterface.php, renamed to ProvidesConsoleCommandsInterface.php during the symfony/console removal and no longer importing any Waaseyaa namespace). Also: HealthChecker's three PRAGMA table_info(...) probes now quote the table/subtable identifier via DatabaseInterface::quoteIdentifier() instead of hand-built `"..."` interpolation (see "Identifier quoting" below); checkIngestion() now reads from an injected IngestionLogger rather than constructing one inline; checkSchemaDrift() no longer reports a blanket pass when every registered table was skipped as lazily-uninitialized (new SCHEMA_DRIFT_CHECK_SKIPPED warn code — see docs/specs/operator-diagnostics.md). Deleted a dead `use Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\SqlSchemaHandler;` import in HealthChecker.php (docblock-only reference). No relocation of HealthChecker/BootDiagnosticReport out of foundation — re-affirms the mission #1257 K6(c) kernel-adjacent codification, not a new decision. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-01 - C-22 WP4 (delete the legacy save engine): EntityTypeManagerFactory no longer builds a storage factory at all — SqlEntityStorage/EntityStorageFactory are deleted. bootEntityTypeManager() now wires only the repository factory (EntityRepository, the sole persistence engine); the kernel passes `null` where a storage-factory closure used to be, so EntityTypeManager::getStorage() is a dormant "bring your own EntityStorageInterface" extension seam post-boot rather than a wired path. SqlStorageDriver (constructed inside the repository-factory closure) gains an optional FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface param to preserve the K2 FieldStorage::Data write/read symmetry fix (issue #1308) that used to live in SqlEntityStorage. See docs/specs/entity-system.md "The legacy save engine is gone (C-22)" for the consumer-facing contract. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-30 - C-22 (remove-legacy-save-engine prerequisite): EntityTypeManagerFactory's repository-factory closure now also captures `$accessHandlerResolver` (the same lazy `fn() => $this->accessHandler ?? null` closure the storage-factory closure has captured since WP16/#1714) and threads it into `EntityRepository`'s optional `accessHandlerResolver` constructor param. This is what lets `EntityRepository::getQuery()` be fail-closed identically to `SqlEntityStorage::getQuery()` — both engines resolve the SAME lazily-populated `EntityAccessHandler` at query time, not at storage/repository construction time (still before `discoverAccessPolicies()` runs, for a repository built/cached mid-boot). No other boot-order or wiring change. See docs/specs/entity-system.md "Two save engines" / "Access-checked query parity (C-22)" for the consumer-facing contract. Acceptance: RepositoryStorageQueryParityTest + the kernel-booting integration suite. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-29 - database-legacy WP6 (#1816, full close of the M1+M2 identifier-quoting hardening): DBALSelect::condition()/orderBy()/isNull()/isNotNull() now AUTO-QUOTE their $field via the platform quoteIdentifier (a reserved-word/metacharacter column is rendered inert), matching DBALUpdate/DBALDelete. Two new SelectInterface seams emit raw expressions verbatim with positional `?` params bound in order: whereRaw(string, array) and orderByRaw(string, string) — developer-supplied-only contract, same as join-ON. The entity read engine no longer pre-quotes: SqlEntityQuery::resolveField() and SqlStorageDriver::resolveField() return a ResolvedField value object (packages/entity-storage/src/ResolvedField.php; sql()/isExpression()/isJsonExtract()); bare/qualified columns route through the auto-quoting condition()/orderBy() path, json_extract(_data,...) expressions route through whereRaw()/orderByRaw(). K3 CAST(... AS TEXT) JSON casting (mission #1257 WP05) preserved inside the whereRaw path. Migrated the one production raw-expression caller, Queue\DbalTransport COALESCE(reserved_at,0) → whereRaw. Supersedes the 2026-06-27 "deferred to #1816" note below. See "Query Builder → Identifier quoting". Acceptance: IdentifierQuotingTest (condition/orderBy/isNull/isNotNull quote inert; whereRaw/orderByRaw verbatim + bound params, incl. array-param IN expansion) + entity-storage query suites green via the raw seams. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-27 - http-client hardening (StreamHttpClient credential-leak + worker-safety): the outbound stream client now (M1) sets follow_location=0 + max_redirects=0 so PHP no longer auto-follows redirects and re-sends the caller's Authorization header to the redirect target (a credential-leak / SSRF pivot affecting the oauth-provider bearer + SendGrid key consumers) — the client returns the 3xx for the caller to handle, so credentials are NEVER auto-re-sent cross-host (chosen approach: disable, not strip); and restricts URLs to http/https (rejects file://, php://, etc.). Companions: m1 pins ssl.verify_peer/verify_peer_name=true (+ allow_self_signed=false) rather than relying on php.ini; m3 bounds the connect phase via default_socket_timeout (set+restored around the call) so a stalled TLS handshake can't hang a worker; m4 caps the response body (stream_get_contents with a 16 MiB ceiling, constructor-configurable) so a runaway endpoint can't OOM the worker; n1 rejects CR/LF in request header names/values before serialization (also hardens mail's header path); m5 captures error_get_last() into the thrown HttpRequestException message + chained \ErrorException previous. Value objects' public API unchanged; m2 (0-status-on-unparseable) left as-is. Acceptance: StreamHttpClientTransportTest (white-box context pins + a real php -S harness proving a cross-host redirect target is never contacted — proven to fail when redirect-following is re-enabled — plus body-cap, CRLF, scheme, and transport-error-context cases). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-27 - scheduler m15 + m2 (ownership-checked lock release): the scheduler overlap lock is now ownership-scoped to stop a split-brain double-run (production-audit m15). LockInterface::acquire() returns a random OWNER TOKEN (bin2hex(random_bytes(16))) or null when held; release() now takes (name, token). DatabaseLock persists the token in a new waaseyaa_schedule_locks.locked_by column (additive idempotent migration 2026_06_27_000001, guarded by SchemaBuilder::hasColumn) and scopes release to `task_name = ? AND locked_by = ?`, so a stale node whose lease expired mid-run (and was reclaimed by another node) deletes nothing instead of tearing down the new owner's live lock. InMemoryLock mirrors the ownership model. Acquire stays atomic (PK on task_name + INSERT-catch-duplicate). m2: the lock TTL is now a per-ScheduledTask property ($task->lockTtl, default 300s) threaded through ScheduleRunner instead of a hardcoded 300, so long tasks set a TTL above their runtime and avoid the mid-run expiry that opens the window. Value/clock injection (m3/m4) deferred. Acceptance: DatabaseLockTest (reclaim steal: A's stale release does NOT delete B's reclaimed lock; owner release deletes its own row — proven to fail on the un-scoped release) + InMemoryLockTest parity. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-27 - database-legacy M1+M2 (identifier-quoting hardening): the query builder now quotes builder-owned identifiers via the platform quoteIdentifier (cross-driver) on the paths where callers pass bare identifiers — DBALSelect::fields()/addField() columns + AS alias, join()/leftJoin() $table + $alias, and the WHERE-field of DBALUpdate/DBALDelete (both the simple Connection::update/delete criteria and applyConditions()). condition()/orderBy() $field is now DOCUMENTED as a developer-supplied raw SQL fragment (column / pre-quoted identifier / expression such as SqlEntityQuery's json_extract(...)) emitted verbatim, never user input — the same contract as the join-ON clause; it is intentionally NOT auto-quoted so the entity query engine keeps working. Value binding unchanged. Full close (auto-quote condition()/orderBy() + whereRaw()/orderByRaw() seams + SqlEntityQuery::resolveField bare-identifier refactor) deferred to #1816. See "Query Builder → Identifier quoting". Acceptance: IdentifierQuotingTest (reserved-word + metacharacter inert through each quoted path; condition()/orderBy() raw-fragment passthrough preserved). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-27 - queue M1 (crash-recovery / visibility timeout): DbalTransport::pop() now reclaims expired leases so a job claimed by a worker that dies (SIGKILL/OOM/reboot) before ack/release is no longer stranded reserved forever (silent data loss). A claim's reserved_at is a lease expiring after visibilityTimeout seconds (ctor arg, default 90, config queue.visibility_timeout); pop selects unreserved OR lease-expired rows via COALESCE(reserved_at,0) <= now-visibilityTimeout, fresh claims guarded by reserved_at IS NULL and reclaims guarded by the exact prior reserved_at (atomicity preserved) while bumping attempts. Worker::processJob gains a pre-handler guard: attempts >= maxTries (Job::tries or WorkerOptions::maxTries; 0=unlimited) → record failed + reject instead of run, so an always-crashing job terminates rather than reclaiming forever. Re-uses the existing reserved_at column — no migration. Acceptance: DbalTransportTest reclaim cases + CrashRecoveryTest (reclaim-then-process, and reclaim-to-exhaustion→failed). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-29 - queue M2 (honest #[UniqueJob]/#[RateLimited] surface): AttributeGuard performs pure in-process/per-PHP-process tracking; it is enforced by SyncQueue but NOT called by DbalQueue (the persistent transport-backed driver) — cross-process enforcement requires a distributed store and is unimplemented. DbalQueue gains optional trailing ?LoggerInterface $logger=null (defaults to NullLogger; existing callers unaffected), and a per-process dedup set. On each dispatch DbalQueue checks for #[UniqueJob]/#[RateLimited] via reflection and logs a warning (once per job class per process) when present; the message is still pushed. UniqueJob.php, RateLimited.php, and AttributeGuard.php gain prominent docblock warnings. Acceptance: DbalQueueTest (UniqueJob → 1 warning + push; dedup → 1 warning on 2 dispatches; RateLimited → 1 warning; plain → 0 warnings; all proven RED before implementation). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-29 - queue M3 (proportional pop() claim retry): DbalTransport::pop() treated a lost claim race (UPDATE affected 0 rows) the same as an empty queue (SELECT no candidate), both consuming one of a 3-iteration budget — a false-empty under contention. The fix replaces for($i<3;$i++) with a while loop where SELECT-no-candidate is the ONLY definitive empty signal; a lost race increments contentionRetries (a separate counter) and retries immediately. A MAX_CLAIM_RETRIES=50 safety bound prevents livelock (generous because each lost race = another worker won = system progress). UPDATE…RETURNING was rejected: MySQL does not support it (portability). All existing semantics preserved: fresh-claim IS NULL guard, expired-lease reclaim + attempts bump + exact prior reserved_at guard, visibility timeout, `release()` untouched. Acceptance: DbalTransportContactionTest (K=5 lost races then success → job returned, NOT null — proven RED against old 3-iteration code; genuine-empty → null; safety-cap → null without infinite loop). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-29 - WP5 foundation wave-2 (route-table inversion + PL008 gate): the 14 `Waaseyaa\Api\*` FQCN route blocks previously hard-coded in `BuiltinRouteRegistrar` moved to `ApiServiceProvider::routes()` (the provider loop already exists). Foundation now registers only the framework-substrate routes it owns (OpenAPI, entity-type lifecycle, broadcast, media upload, attachment download, search, discovery, SSR catch-alls). All route names/paths/options are preserved — behavior-neutral. The inversion eliminates the hidden L0→L4 string-literal coupling that the existing PL005 `use`-statement scanner could not catch because `BuiltinRouteRegistrar` is Kernel/-exempt. A new gate `check-package-layers` PL008 now catches quoted `Waaseyaa\<Ns>\…` FQCN string literals in L0 `src/` files where the namespace maps to a higher layer; allowlist: `tools/package-layers-string-literal-baseline.txt`; self-test: `bin/check-package-layers-pl008-self-test` (wired into `composer verify`). After the inversion, PL008 finds zero new violations on the full tree. Acceptance: `ApiServiceProviderAdminRoutesTest` (14 moved routes + auth assertions), updated `SchemaSurfaceRequiresAuthTest`, updated `BuiltinRouteRegistrarTest` / `HttpKernelTest`, and 8 updated integration phase tests that wire `BuiltinRouteRegistrar` with `[new ApiServiceProvider()]` as provider. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-23 - CL-13 slice 1 (attachment private-file download): foundation's BuiltinRouteRegistrar now registers a new option-less route GET /attachment/{id}/download → controller string 'attachment.download'. The route is registered centrally here (next to media.upload) because the L2 attachment package cannot depend on routing (L4); the handler (Waaseyaa\Attachment\Http\AttachmentDownloadRouter, a foundation DomainRouterInterface contributed via HasHttpDomainRoutersInterface) is the enforcement point — deny-by-default view check delegated to the parent entity, fail-closed, 404-on-deny, streaming bytes only from the private:// root (storage/private-files) via PrivateFileStore with realpath containment. No change to any other route or to the route-dispatch contract. Substantive contract documented in CHANGELOG (### Added) + the package docblocks; acceptance: packages/attachment/tests/Integration/AttachmentDownloadRouterTest. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-23 - schema-surface auth (audit): foundation's BuiltinRouteRegistrar now registers GET /api/schema/{entity_type} and GET /api/openapi.json with requireAuthentication() (_authenticated) instead of option-less. Both were anonymous-reachable and enumerated every entity type plus its field schema; field-access was computed against a value-less prototype, over-disclosing instance-state-gated field DEFINITIONS to anonymous. They are the self-description of an already-auth-gated API (consistent with #1649 auth-gating the /api discovery index). SCOPE: only these two REST routes; the public read-only /mcp surface and /.well-known/waaseyaa-anchors.json catalog (other providers) are unchanged. /api/entity-types stays option-less (type-id enumeration only) pending a separate decision. Substantive contract: docs/specs/api-layer.md "Schema self-description surface requires authentication". Acceptance: tests/Integration/SchemaSurfaceRequiresAuthTest (anonymous 401 / authenticated passes; both failed open pre-fix). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-22 - WP16 (alpha245 security, issue #1714): AbstractKernel now threads its EntityAccessHandler into entity storage so getQuery() is fail-closed in production. The kernel's storage factory closure built SqlEntityStorage with accessHandler=null, so getQuery() fell back to an EMPTY EntityAccessHandler (every non-Forbidden row passed) — fail-OPEN despite the fail-closed docblock. The closure now passes accessHandlerResolver: fn() => $this->accessHandler ?? null; the resolver is invoked at getQuery() time (not construction), so a storage built and cached mid-boot — before discoverAccessPolicies() populates $this->accessHandler — still sees the real policy-laden handler at query time. System-context callers still opt out via accessCheck(false). No change to callers that already wired a handler explicitly. See entity-system.md for the SqlEntityStorage/EntityStorageFactory seam. Acceptance: EntityStorageFactoryAccessWiringTest + the kernel-booting integration suite. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-21 - issue #1651 security-headers wiring: SecurityHeadersMiddleware was compiled into the http middleware manifest (#[AsMiddleware priority 100]) but NEVER instantiated — HttpKernel builds its pipeline from a hardcoded list + HasMiddlewareInterface providers, and that pipeline's inner handler returns a stub 200, so a pipeline middleware would decorate the stub, not the controller's real response. Every response was therefore frameable (clickjacking gap). Fix: new static `SecurityHeadersMiddleware::applyResponseDefaults(Request, Response, frameOptions='SAMEORIGIN')` applied post-dispatch in HttpKernel (next to CsrfMiddleware::attachCookieIfHtml). It sets `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` (configurable via config `security_headers.frame_options`; OMITTED when the route set the `_frame_exempt` request attribute — the per-route opt-out for cross-origin embeds, preserving the same-origin inline previews consumers rely on) and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`; existing headers are never overwritten. CSP and HSTS stay opt-in via the middleware constructor (default-src 'self' would break the SPA; HSTS needs HTTPS). Substantive contracts: docs/specs/security-defaults.md + docs/specs/middleware-pipeline.md. Acceptance: SecurityHeadersMiddlewareTest. -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-21 - issue #1611 persistent rate limiting + DatabaseInterface resolution: new `Waaseyaa\Foundation\RateLimit\DatabaseRateLimiter` implements `RateLimiterInterface` over the kernel's persistent `DatabaseInterface` (table `rate_limit_windows`: key/count/window_start), with the same fixed-window semantics as `InMemoryRateLimiter` but durable across requests and workers — the in-memory limiter is a per-request no-op under php-fpm/FrankenPHP. The shipped default binding remains `InMemoryRateLimiter` (no writable table required); apps bind `RateLimiterInterface` to `DatabaseRateLimiter` to limit across requests. SEPARATELY, the alpha.188 "resolve(DatabaseInterface) at route-build is ephemeral, writes vanish" report no longer reproduces: `ProviderRegistryKernelServices::get(DatabaseInterface::class)` returns the kernel's single bootstrapped `$this->database` verbatim (not a fresh connection), so a build-time capture is the persistent connection. Pinned by ProviderRegistryKernelServicesTest + DatabaseRateLimiterTest (cross-connection persistence). No contract surface removed; additive. -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-21 - issue #1704 realtime SSE stability (residual 503 + subscriber-tracking wiring): `BroadcastRouter` gains a per-account concurrent-stream cap (DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS = 6, DEFAULT_RETRY_AFTER_SEC = 5). `handle()` counts the requesting account's currently-active streams from the process-shared subscribers.json via the pure static `BroadcastRouter::countActiveStreamsForAccount(rows, accountId, now, staleAfterSec)` (rows older than the max stream lifetime are treated as dead and excluded) and, when the account is at the cap, returns `503` + `Retry-After` BEFORE building the StreamedResponse — backpressure against the rapid-reload reconnect storm that can saturate the single-process FrankenPHP worker pool. New ctor params `maxConcurrentStreams`/`retryAfterSec` (defaults from the constants); 0 disables the cap. The count→admit window is intentionally unlocked (coarse safety valve, not an exact ceiling). SEPARATELY, `HttpKernel` now constructs `BroadcastRouter` WITH the subscribers.json path (`<storage>/broadcast/subscribers.json`, resolved identically to MercureMonitorServiceProvider's read side and gated by the same `broadcasting.monitor.enabled` flag); previously the path was null, so the write side (subscriber tracking) was dormant and the monitor dashboard's list was always empty. Wiring it activates both the monitor view and the cap. Substantive broadcast contract: docs/specs/broadcasting.md. Acceptance: BroadcastRouterTest. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-21 - issue #1707 realtime SSE stability (Failure A/B): `BroadcastRouter::handle()`'s stream closure now calls `session_write_close()` (BroadcastRouter.php:179-180, guarded by function_exists + PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE) immediately after `handle()` has captured everything the stream needs ($channels, $sessionToken), releasing the PHPSESSID file lock for the stream's whole lifetime so concurrent same-session requests (document reloads, /api/* fetches, a second admin tab) no longer block in session_start() behind a live /api/broadcast SSE — the root cause of the 15-25s admin "blank". The closure also explicitly clears `ignore_user_abort(false)` (BroadcastRouter.php:191-192) for the stream lifetime (FrankenPHP/php-fpm set it true at bootstrap, suppressing connection_aborted()) and re-probes the abort signal after each keepalive/message-batch flush, so an abandoned stream releases its worker within one keepalive (~2s) instead of pinning it for the full DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_SEC budget. Behavior/hardening only: the SSE `connected` frame, resolveSubscriberChannels, retained-message replay, and the bounded-loop cap (streamShouldContinue) are all unchanged; no broadcast contract surface changed. Substantive broadcast contract: docs/specs/broadcasting.md. Acceptance: BroadcastRouterTest. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-20 - mission windows-runtime-ergonomics-01KVGEPD (scoped up): the FrankenPHP dev runtime is now an OPTIONAL package `waaseyaa/frankenphp` (Layer 6), the Laravel Octane model — NOT core. It registers two console commands via its own FrankenPhpServiceProvider: `frankenphp:install` (downloads the correct binary for the OS/arch from php/frankenphp releases into vendor/bin — on Windows the full SDK zip is extracted into vendor/bin/frankenphp-dist/ so frankenphp.exe finds its DLLs; ext-zip or bsdtar; sha256-verified vs the release digest; idempotent) and `dev` (resolves the binary by absolute path via `Waaseyaa\FrankenPhp\Binary\BinaryResolver` — FRANKENPHP_BIN → managed install → known per-OS locations → PATH → offer-install — then execs `frankenphp php-server` shell-free with inherited stdio, never touching PATH or the bundled php.exe). This SUPERSEDES + REMOVES the alpha.229 `Foundation\Runtime\FrankenPhpLocator` (the prior FrankenPHP coupling in core foundation) and the `skeleton/bin/dev` launcher; the skeleton now wires `composer run dev` → `@php vendor/bin/waaseyaa dev`. Core stays runtime-agnostic (the obsolete review note below is retained for history). Pure logic (AssetSelector/BinaryResolver/Installer orchestration) is unit-tested in packages/frankenphp/tests; package not in core/cms/full; carried by the framework meta so the skeleton has it by default.

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-19 - mission wayfinding-01KVGH5X Phase 2: reserved per-session broadcast channels. New `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Http\Router\SessionChannel` (PREFIX 'session:', token = substr(sha256(session_id),0,32), forSessionId/forToken/isReserved). `BroadcastRouter::handle()` now computes the connection's own session channel server-side (from session_id) and runs requested channels through the new pure static `BroadcastRouter::resolveSubscriberChannels(requested, ownSessionChannel)`, which STRIPS any client-supplied reserved `session:*` channel (a client may not name another session's private channel), defaults to ['admin'] when no public channel survives, and appends the connection's own session channel. The SSE `connected` frame gains a non-secret `sessionToken`. This enforces session isolation (NFR-001) for any per-session push, not just Wayfinding. Additive only — public-channel behaviour (admin entity events) and the bounded-loop guarantee (DEFAULT_MAX_DURATION_SEC) are unchanged; resolveSubscriberChannels is unit-tested.

Resolution order: FRANKENPHP_BIN env → known per-OS locations (Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.frankenphp\frankenphp.exe; POSIX: /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, /opt/homebrew/bin, ~/.frankenphp) → `frankenphp` on PATH (resolved to absolute) → actionable RuntimeException. `locate()` is pure (injectable fileExists + pathLookup probes — unit-tested for every branch); `fromEnvironment()` wires the real probes (getenv/PHP_OS_FAMILY/is_file + where/command -v). Rationale: the launcher execs frankenphp BY FULL PATH and never adds the install dir to PATH, so the official Windows release's bundled OpenSSL-disabled php.exe cannot shadow system PHP and break Composer. No kernel/boot/contract surface changed; this is a standalone foundation helper consumed by skeleton tooling. See docs/specs/operations-playbooks.md "launch FrankenPHP". -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-12 - mission request-surface-hardening-01KTX7F2 WP03 (#1650): database path resolution made CWD-independent. DatabaseBootstrapper gains a public static resolveDatabasePath(string $projectRoot, array $config) — the canonical resolver: precedence unchanged (config['database'] → WAASEYAA_DB env → {projectRoot}/storage/waaseyaa.sqlite), but a relative value from EITHER source now absolutizes against the project root (leading ./ stripped); :memory:, leading /, Windows drive-letter (X: + separator), and UNC (\\) values pass through byte-identical; climbing ../ relatives concatenate onto the project root. boot() gains a trailing ?LoggerInterface $logger = null (NullLogger default; AbstractKernel:197 passes $this->logger) and warns once per boot — never refuses — when the lexically normalized resolved path (separator unification + ./.. segment resolution, deliberately no realpath()) is contained in {projectRoot}/public (FR-008 docroot warning; :memory: never warns). CLI parity: DbInitHandler::resolveDatabasePath() now delegates to the same static (its divergent verbatim-config/POSIX-only absolutize() is gone), and HealthReportHandler/AboutHandler display the resolved path instead of the raw env value. Invariant: the resolved path is a pure function of (configured value, projectRoot); HTTP under a docroot CWD and the CLI open the same file (SC-004). Production missing-db guard and non-production @mkdir semantics unchanged on the resolved path. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-04 - PR #1614: kernel + foundation changes. New Foundation capability interface `AcceptsMigrationProvidersInterface` (Tier 3, documented in the ServiceProvider extension-hooks table below) gates `AbstractKernel::injectMigrationProviders()`, so the kernel hands the discovered migration providers to the migration ServiceProvider via a named interface instead of a concrete-FQCN `instanceof` (keeps the contract test's "kernel call sites resolve to an interface" invariant). `HttpKernel` gained `shouldUseDevFallbackAccount()` (development APP_ENV + `auth.dev_fallback_account` opt-in) for the local dev admin account. `PackageManifestCompiler` broadened its provider-scan `catch (\ReflectionException)` to `catch (\Throwable)` so a package shipping a class under `src/` that extends a dev-only symbol cannot crash a consumer's kernel boot. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-09 - alpha.201 #1630: backfilled real READMEs for the add-on packages (inertia, groups, notification, mercure, workflows). Documentation only — no change to any infrastructure contract, service-provider wiring, or runtime behaviour. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-28 - M5C WP01 (mcp-endpoint-admin-01KSEFTL) BuiltinRouteRegistrar gains three `_role: admin` routes for the MCP-admin REST surface — GET /api/mcp/tools, GET /api/mcp/tools/{name}, GET /api/mcp/server-config — all registered via string FQCN ('Waaseyaa\\Api\\Controller\\McpAdminController'). Controller-side contract (DomainRouterInterface dispatch via McpAdminApiRouter, DTOs, NFR-003 no-plaintext-token guarantee) is owned by docs/specs/api-layer.md; this entry records only the route-registrar surface change. Pre-existing built-in routes unchanged. Also notes: McpServiceProvider (Layer 6) now binds ToolRegistryReadModelInterface + ServerConfigReadModelInterface via `$this->resolve(...)` / `$this->resolveOptional(...)` (the previous `$this->make(...)` form was retired — that method does not exist on the L0 ServiceProvider base and crashed kernel boot on installs exercising the MCP-admin surface). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-24 - M4A-5 Phase 1 (#1470) workflow guards routes: BuiltinRouteRegistrar gets one more `_role: admin` route — GET /api/workflow-definitions/{workflow_id}/guards — registered via string FQCN ('Waaseyaa\\Api\\Controller\\WorkflowGuardsController'), same L0→L4 layer-safe pattern. WorkflowServiceProvider (packages/workflows, Layer 3) binds AuthoringRoleMatrix as a container singleton with editorial workflow guards seeded from EditorialTransitionAccessResolver::allowedRolesForTransition() — without this binding the dashboard surface was dead code in production (cycle-2 fix). Existing entity-type registration in WorkflowServiceProvider unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-24 - #1576 post-merge fixup: DbalTransport::applyStatusFilter() now captures the fluent return from DBALSelect::isNull/isNotNull. No contract change — pure code-style cleanup to satisfy DBAL's fluent-builder warning under failOnWarning=true. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-24 - #1576 TransportInterface::listJobs() extension: new mandatory method on the queue Transport contract (`@api`). DbalTransport implements via separate COUNT+SELECT against waaseyaa_queue_jobs (reserved_at IS NULL → queued, NOT NULL → in_progress). InMemoryTransport merges $queues + $reserved sorted by id. Existing push/pop/ack/reject/release/size/purge unchanged. New abstract contract test in packages/queue/tests/Contract/ (AbstractTransportContract base + concrete subclasses per backend) exercises both implementations against the same expectations. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-24 - M4C (#1472) admin notification channels: BuiltinRouteRegistrar gains two more `_role: admin` routes registered via the same string-FQCN pattern (`'Waaseyaa\\Api\\Controller\\NotificationController'`) — index at /api/notification/channels and test at /api/notification/channels/{type}/test. NotificationDispatcher (packages/notification) gains one public read accessor (`channels(): array`) so the L4 ApiServiceProvider can enumerate registered channels for the dashboard. No other notification-package behaviour changes; send/sendAsync/sendToMany unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-24 - M4B (#1471) admin queue + scheduler dashboards: BuiltinRouteRegistrar gains five new `_role: admin` routes (three for the queue surface — index/retry/discard at /api/queue/jobs — and two for the scheduler — index at /api/scheduler/tasks and trigger at /api/scheduler/tasks/{name}/trigger). All five register via string FQCN ('Waaseyaa\\Api\\Controller\\QueueController' / 'Waaseyaa\\Api\\Controller\\SchedulerController') to avoid an upward L0→L4 import. SchedulerServiceProvider (packages/scheduler) additionally binds ScheduleStateRepository as a container singleton in the database driver so the L4 ApiServiceProvider can resolveOptional() it for the dashboard's last_run / last_status display; pre-existing ScheduleRunner factory is now passed the resolved instance instead of `new`-ing it inline — behaviour-preserving refactor. ScheduleRunner gained a new public `runOne(string $taskName, \\DateTimeInterface $now)` for the dashboard "Run now" action (bypasses isDue() per operator intent; still honours preventOverlap). See docs/specs/api-layer.md for the controller-side contract and docs/specs/admin-spa.md for the SPA route inventory. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-22 - M3 WP01 (bimaaji-mcp-bridge-01KS5VS8): retired the dead foundation McpRouter intercept (deleted packages/foundation/src/Http/Router/McpRouter.php + its entry in HttpKernel::$foundationRouters at line 411 + McpRouterTest). The router guarded a literal `_controller === 'mcp.endpoint'` string that no real route ever set — only artificial unit-test fixtures did. Production /mcp dispatch already flows through SSR's AppControllerRouter to Waaseyaa\Mcp\McpEndpoint::handle. HttpKernel.php otherwise unchanged (the $mcpReadCache field + cache-listener registrar paths remain — still consumed by legacy McpController via direct instantiation in tests/Integration/Phase14/AiMcpIntegrationTest.php). See docs/specs/mcp-endpoint.md for the corresponding MCP-side stamp. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-20 - M-D scheduler-entry sprint: new Waaseyaa\Scheduler\ScheduleEntriesInterface (L0) is auto-discovered by PackageManifestCompiler (scanPsr4Classes filters /testing/ dirs to keep autoload-dev classes out of production scans). AbstractKernel::boot() calls bootScheduleEntries() after discoverAccessPolicies(); ScheduleEntryRegistry instantiates implementors via M-B's PolicyDependencyResolverInterface and registers them on a single Schedule instance. Fail-closed: an unresolvable dep throws ScheduleEntryInstantiationException and aborts boot. schedule.disabled_entries opt-out honored. Implementors today: AgentScheduleEntries (ai:purge-runs, ai:reap-stalled-runs), BroadcastStorageScheduleEntries (broadcast_log_prune nightly). See docs/specs/operations-playbooks.md for the operator-facing surface. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-20 - BroadcastRouter no longer replays _broadcast_log history on EventSource connect. New SSE connection cursor: BroadcastRouter::resolveInitialCursor(Request, int $highWaterMark) — resumes from numeric `Last-Event-ID` header when present (auto-reconnect path), else returns BroadcastStorage::maxId($channels) (start-from-now). Each emitted SSE frame now carries `id: {row_id}` so EventSource sends Last-Event-ID on its native reconnect. BroadcastStorage gained public maxId(array $channels = []): int. Behavioral change visible to consumers: a fresh EventSource no longer receives historical entity.saved/entity.deleted events — clients that need backlog must query their own state. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-18 - DiagnosticCode::MANIFEST_VERSIONING_MISSING remediation message edited to drop the `bin/check-milestones` hint sentence (script deleted as part of the GitHub-milestones decommission). Diagnostic code identity, severity, and triggering call sites unchanged; no infrastructure contract surface affected. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-13 - #1394 HttpKernel::applyTrustedProxiesFromConfig() invoked at the start of serveHttpRequest() before any code reads $request->isSecure(). Sources: $this->config['trusted_proxies'] (typed; wins) -> TRUSTED_PROXIES env var (comma-separated CIDRs / IPs / Symfony's REMOTE_ADDR sentinel). When the resolved list is non-empty, calls Request::setTrustedProxies with HEADER_X_FORWARDED_{FOR,HOST,PROTO,PORT}. Empty list preserves the pre-fix default (X-Forwarded-* headers ignored — the safe default for setups without a TLS terminator). Internal kernel boot logic; not part of the public surface map. No infrastructure contract surface changed. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-12 - #1443 AbstractKernel::validateQueryDefinitions() added after discoverAccessPolicies() in boot(); wires DefinitionValidator (entity-storage L1) via BackendRegistrarFactory+BackendResolver for FR-021 fail-fast enforcement.

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-10 - WP03 php-8.5 upgrade: DBALSelect fluent methods (fields/addField/condition/isNull/isNotNull/orderBy/range/join/leftJoin/countQuery) gained #[\NoDiscard] — no change to query builder semantics or DBAL abstraction contract. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-08 - issue #1397: `Worker::run()` enforces `WorkerOptions::$memoryLimit` as MiB of **additional** allocation since the start of each `run()` call (`memory_get_usage(true)` baseline), not total PHP process RSS — embedded hosts (PHPUnit full suite, long-lived FPM) may already exceed the cap before `run()` begins; see `packages/queue/src/Worker/Worker.php`. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-04d - issue #1301 (deferred mission #1257 WP09): portable orphan-bundle-subtable detection. SchemaInterface gained `listTableNames(): list<string>` (DBALSchema delegates to Doctrine's AbstractSchemaManager::listTableNames()). HealthChecker::findOrphanSubtables() replaced the SQLite-only `sqlite_master` LIKE query with `$this->database->schema()->listTableNames()` + `str_starts_with($name, $baseTable . '__')` filter — portable across SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and any other DBAL-supported driver. The `\Throwable` swallow path is gone (no longer needed). See docs/specs/bundle-scoped-storage.md §"Drift diagnostic" and docs/specs/operator-diagnostics.md §"Bundle Subtable Drift" for the operator-facing contract update. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-04c - issue #1376 (deferred WP07-A from mission #1257): AbstractKernel::bootEntityTypeManager() now passes a bundle-subtable existence probe to EntityTypeManager so addBundleFields() can emit a once-per-(entity_type_id, bundle) `[BUNDLE_SUBTABLE_MISSING]` notice when the per-bundle subtable is not yet materialized on disk. Probe uses `$database->schema()->tableExists(SqlSchemaHandler::resolveSubtableName(...))`. See docs/specs/entity-system.md (header) for the full contract. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-04b - issue #1309: added `COLUMN_DATA_STORAGE_DRIFT` to the DiagnosticCode table. HealthChecker gained `checkColumnDataStorageDrift()` (called from `checkRuntime()`), which warns when a field registered with `FieldStorage::Data` still has a backing column on the base table or a registered bundle subtable. Severity: warning. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-04 - cs-fixer sweep applied to AbstractKernel.php (alphabetical import sort only, no behavior change). Spec contents verified accurate; no infrastructure-spec contract changed. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-02b - mission #1257 WP10 review hardening (PR #1367): `AbstractKernel::resolveCommunityScope()` no longer falls back to a null scope unconditionally when tenancy is declared but no `CommunityContextInterface` is bound. In production (any environment NOT in {local, dev, development, testing}), missing context throws `[TENANCY_MISCONFIGURED] RuntimeException` — silent disablement of community isolation in production is a data-leak posture, not a tolerable misconfiguration. In development the prior log-once + null-scope path stays so tests / CLI / bare bootstrap don't crash. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-02 - mission #1257 WP10: AbstractKernel gained `setCommunityContext(?CommunityContextInterface)` plus a private `resolveCommunityScope(EntityTypeInterface)` helper that the EntityRepository factory uses to inject CommunityScope into SqlStorageDriver when the EntityType declares `tenancy: ['scope' => 'community']`. When tenancy is declared but no context is bound, the kernel logs a once-per-type warning and falls back to a null scope (no boot crash; superseded by the 2026-05-02b production-throw guard above). EntityTypeManager now also receives the kernel logger so it can emit the C1 deprecation warning. Wiring contract details live in docs/specs/entity-system.md §C1 / §Community Scoping; no infrastructure-spec contract changed. -->

Also reverted an incorrect fix that had added `waaseyaa/ssr` as a hard `require` of foundation's composer.json — that violated the layer rule (layer 0 must not depend on layer 6) and tripped `LayerDependencyTest::foundationDoesNotDependOnHigherLayerPackages`. The pre-existing architectural debt it was trying to paper over (HttpKernel directly imports `Waaseyaa\SSR\RenderCache`, `SsrPageHandler`, `SsrServiceProvider`, `TwigErrorPageRenderer`; `SsrRouter` and `AppControllerRouter` live in foundation but require `SsrPageHandler`; `EventListenerRegistrar::registerRenderCacheListeners()` type-hints `RenderCache`) is tracked as a separate P1 refactor follow-up to #571. -->

Infrastructure-layer split packages that ship as Packagist libraries are expected to carry the normal release metadata shape in `composer.json`: `minimum-stability: stable` and branch aliases for `dev-main` plus the active maintenance branch. That invariant matters for local path-repository workflows because canonical path repos must still satisfy `^0.1` constraints when apps override published packages during development.

### Composer layer graph

The monorepo enforces the seven-layer rule from `CLAUDE.md` on **runtime** Composer edges: `bin/check-package-layers` walks `packages/*/composer.json` and fails if any `require` entry `waaseyaa/*` targets a package **strictly above** the declaring package’s layer. Metapackages (`cms`, `core`, `full`) are skipped. The canonical short-name → layer map lives only in `bin/check-package-layers` and is available to secondary tooling through `--layer-map=json`; `bin/audit-require-dev-layers` consumes that export for its non-fatal upward `require-dev` report. Package manifests do not carry a second `extra.waaseyaa.layer` value. When you add a new first-party package, extend the gate map and the Layer Architecture table in `CLAUDE.md` together. This supersedes ad-hoc checks for historical issues such as foundation → path or validation → entity at the manifest level.

PHPStan analyses the roster-wide `packages` root while excluding non-source test support, migrations/scripts/config, the Nuxt-only admin tree, and Deployer's recipe DSL. It does not enumerate individual `packages/*/src` paths, so a new PHP package enters static analysis automatically; `bin/check-phpstan-paths` asserts that single-root shape.

The PHP layer graph covers the **62 PHP packages** under `packages/` plus the three metapackages (`cms`, `core`, `full`, all skipped). `packages/admin/` is a Nuxt SPA (no `composer.json`, zero PHP source) and is not part of the PHP layer hierarchy; its PHP host extension is `waaseyaa/admin-surface`, which is what L6 actually means here.

The same script also scans every package's `src/**/*.php` for `use Waaseyaa\X\…` imports and fails on any import whose target package sits **above** the importing package's layer. This catches cross-layer leaks that don't show up in `composer.json` (e.g. a Foundation listener referencing an L1 entity event class without declaring an upward `require`). Diagnostics are emitted as `FAIL [PL005]` and name the offending file, the importing package's layer, and the imported package's layer.

A second scan — **rule PL008** — covers the complementary blind spot: higher-layer FQCN references in every package's `src/` files that PL005 cannot see because they are not plain `use` imports — FQCNs inside string scalars (e.g. `'Waaseyaa\\Ns\\...'`) and inline fully-qualified name tokens (see the tokenizer paragraph below). The CLAUDE.md "Layer discipline for imports" rule deliberately permits string constants for reviewed cross-layer seams (where a `use` import would be an upward violation), but each legitimate entry must be allowlisted by file with a rationale in `tools/package-layers-string-literal-baseline.txt`. New violations fail CI (fail-on-new); the self-test in `bin/check-package-layers-pl008-self-test` (wired into `composer verify`) asserts fire-on-violator and green-after-allowlist for both sub-patterns. Widening beyond Layer 0 surfaced and explicitly baselined one event-decoupled audit listener and three Bimaaji→CLI optional-runtime integration files; these remain visible debt rather than scanner exclusions.

The package layer and namespace resolver indices are a single enforcement boundary. Startup rule **PL009** requires exact parity between the layer short names and namespace-map targets, including AI subnamespaces, before any source scan runs. This prevents an unmapped namespace (the historical `attachment` gap) from being silently skipped by PL005/PL008. Historical same-layer cycles are separately explicit in `tools/package-layers-cycle-baseline.txt`: **PL006** warns only for the five reviewed pairs in that file and fails on every new mutual runtime-require pair.

**PL008 sub-pattern (b) — inline fully-qualified name tokens, and the tokenizer rewrite (WP7 audit remediation + same-WP adversarial-review fix round):** the original PL008 was a raw-text regex that required a leading quote character, so it only caught QUOTED string-literal FQCNs with raw double-backslash separators (e.g. `'Waaseyaa\\Node\\Foo'`). WP7 first added an inline-`::class` regex for the shape found in `packages/foundation/src/Http/ControllerDispatcher.php`'s `!\class_exists(\Waaseyaa\SSR\SsrPageHandler::class)` optional-dependency probe (invisible to PL005 — no `use` statement — and to the quote-anchored regex). Adversarial review of that regex then found three confirmed evasions and a false positive: static access `\Waaseyaa\Node\Foo::make()` passed (only the literal `::class` suffix was matched, despite static access being WORSE coupling — it autoloads at runtime); `'\Waaseyaa\Node\Foo'` (leading backslash inside the quotes) and single-backslash `'Waaseyaa\Node\Foo'` (valid PHP in single-quoted strings) both passed; and a trailing same-line comment mentioning an FQCN FAILED the gate on legitimate code (only whole-comment lines were stripped). `$scanStringLiteralFqcns` is now **tokenizer-based** (`token_get_all`, purely lexical): `T_COMMENT`/`T_DOC_COMMENT` tokens are dropped whole (exact comment stripping — trailing same-line comments and docblock `@see` references can never fire); sub-pattern (a) scans `T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING`/`T_ENCAPSED_AND_WHITESPACE` token text (quoted strings, interpolated parts, heredoc/nowdoc bodies) with a separator-tolerant regex (one OR two raw backslashes, up to two leading); sub-pattern (b) flags any `T_NAME_FULLY_QUALIFIED` token starting `\Waaseyaa\` — covering `::class`, `::method()`, `::CONST`, `::$prop`, `new \Waaseyaa\…\Foo()`, `instanceof`, fully-qualified type hints, and leading-backslash `use \Waaseyaa\…;` imports (also invisible to PL005's regex), with multi-line `name … ::class` splits caught for free since the match is on the name token itself. `T_NAME_QUALIFIED` (relative qualified names) is deliberately not flagged — those resolve against the current namespace and any enabling `use` import is PL005's job. Both sub-patterns share the PL008 rule ID, finding/baseline/emit path, and per-file baseline (`tools/package-layers-string-literal-baseline.txt` — note its header: baselining is per-FILE, so re-audit the whole file for unrelated upward references before adding an entry). `ControllerDispatcher.php` was fixed by using its already-declared `SSR_PAGE_HANDLER` string constant at the callsite and baselined. The broadened scan surfaced two pre-existing offenders repo-wide — `foundation/src/ServiceProvider/ServiceProvider.php` and `ServiceProviderInterface.php`, whose `routes()` hook uses inline fully-qualified type hints (`\Waaseyaa\Routing\WaaseyaaRouter` L4, `\Waaseyaa\Entity\EntityTypeManager` L1) as the deliberate provider extension seam — both baselined with rationale (type hints resolve lazily and cannot be string constants; changing the signature would break every provider override via parameter contravariance; follow-up noted in the baseline). Coverage: `tests/Architecture/CheckPackageLayersGateTest.php` (11 PL008 fixture cases: quoted literal, inline `::class`, static access, leading-backslash quoted, single-backslash quoted, `new` instantiation, baseline suppression, same-layer no-false-positive, trailing `//` and `/* */` comments not flagged, docblock `@see` not flagged; fixture runs pass `WAASEYAA_LAYER_STRING_LITERAL_BASELINE=/dev/null` for isolation from the real baseline) and `bin/check-package-layers-pl008-self-test` (wired into `composer verify`; now exercises both sub-patterns fire-on-violator + green-after-allowlist). Re-verification of the rewrite additionally hardened PL005: its `use`-import regex now tolerates an optional leading backslash (`use \Waaseyaa\...;` previously evaded the file-level scan in every layer; PL008(b) only covered Layer 0), pinned by a non-L0 fixture test. PL008's per-dep FAIL line lists all violating files (not just the first), and two accepted lexical-scan limits are documented in the scanner docblock and baseline header: lowercase FQCNs evade (Composer PSR-4 prefix matching is case-sensitive, so a lowercase string cannot trigger upward autoloading), and diagnostic messages that merely mention an FQCN are a known false-positive class (prefer rephrasing over baselining).

### Kernel exemption surface (named files)

Some bootstrapper code intentionally sees across layers — kernels wire entity-type managers, route registrars register controllers from any layer, cache invalidators subscribe to events from higher layers. Two complementary exemption tiers in `bin/check-package-layers` codify this:

| Tier | Mechanism | Use for |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Implicit | `KERNEL_EXEMPT_DIR_SUFFIXES` (currently `/src/Kernel/`) | Files inside `<pkg>/src/Kernel/` — the canonical kernel/bootstrapper boundary documented in `CLAUDE.md` "Layer Architecture > Exemption" |
| Explicit | `KERNEL_EXEMPT_FILES` (path → rationale) | Kernel-adjacent files that must live outside `Kernel/` (route registrars wired only from `HttpKernel`, diagnostics wired only from `ConsoleKernel`, listeners wired only from a `ServiceProvider`) |

Each `KERNEL_EXEMPT_FILES` entry carries a one-line rationale string so future readers can audit whether the exemption is still load-bearing. To land a new kernel-adjacent file, either move it under `<pkg>/src/Kernel/` (preferred — the Composer-graph picture stays clean) or add an explicit named entry; the gate refuses to merge an unjustified cross-layer leak.

The named-file surface was added in mission #824 WP02 surface C and is the prerequisite for mission #1257 K6(c) (`HealthChecker` codified as kernel-adjacent rather than relocated).

**PHPUnit-level mirror (WP6 foundation layer-gate scope, #1855–#1863 batch).** `bin/check-package-layers` is the standalone CI gate for this invariant, but until this WP it was the *only* enforcement — `packages/foundation/tests/Unit/LayerDependencyTest.php`'s file-scan test only covered `src/Http/` (added for the Http-substrate pattern specifically), leaving the rest of `src/` (including `src/Diagnostic/`) unchecked by the faster PHPUnit suite. `LayerDependencyTest::foundationSrcOutsideKernelAndHttpSubstrateDoesNotImportForbiddenLayerPackages()` extends the scan to all of `src/`, skipping `Kernel/` (bulk) and `Http/Router/` / `Http/Inbound/` (governed only by `bin/check-package-layers`' allowlist scan — the Http-substrate PHPUnit test skips those two directories as well, so no PHPUnit-level check covers them), with its own `SRC_SCAN_EXEMPT_FILES` allowlist mirroring `$kernelExemptFiles` above one-for-one. The two lists are maintained independently (a PHPUnit test can't safely `require` a script that calls `exit()`), so a change to one must be mirrored in the other by hand until they're unified.

The `Http/Router/` built-in domain routers (`JsonApiRouter`, `SchemaRouter`, `SearchRouter`, `TranslationRouter`, `EntityTypeLifecycleRouter`, `WorkflowDefinitionsApiRouter`, `BroadcastRouter`) plus the `WaaseyaaContext` request DTO are a **permanent** entry in this surface, not a staging area: the kernel owns the `DomainRouterInterface` contract (L0, public) and eagerly constructs these concretes inside `HttpKernel::dispatch()` so the JSON:API/SSE chain exists before any provider-supplied routers and the terminal `BroadcastRouter` — including on a `waaseyaa/core`-only install with no `api` ServiceProvider.

### ServiceProvider extension hooks

Every `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\ServiceProvider` exposes a fixed set of hooks the kernel calls during bootstrap. Three tiers exist; the contract test at `packages/foundation/tests/Contract/ServiceProviderContractTest.php` keeps all three in lockstep with the actual kernel call sites (mission #824 WP03 surface B). Adding a Tier 1 method, removing a Tier 2 method, or wiring a new `instanceof`-guarded call site without an allowlist entry fails the contract test — drift cannot land silently.

**Tier 1 — `ServiceProviderInterface` (the public contract).** Every provider implements these; removing or signature-changing one breaks third-party providers.

| Method | Caller | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `register(): void` | `ProviderRegistry::discoverAndRegister()` | Bind services. Called once per registration pass after `setKernelContext` and `setKernelServices`. |
| `boot(): void` | `ProviderRegistry::boot()` | Late wiring after every provider has registered. Subscribe to events, warm caches. |
| `routes(WaaseyaaRouter, EntityTypeManager): void` | `BuiltinRouteRegistrar::register()` | Contribute HTTP routes. |
| `provides(): list<string>` | `ProviderRegistry` (deferred check) | Service ids the provider intends to bind. |
| `isDeferred(): bool` | `ProviderRegistry` (deferred check) | Whether `register()` may be deferred until a `provides()` service is requested. |
| `getBindings(): array<string, array{concrete, shared}>` | `HttpKernel`, `HttpKernelServiceResolver`, `ProviderRegistryKernelServices` | Local bindings registered by this provider. |
| `resolve(string): object` | `HttpKernel`, `HttpKernelServiceResolver`, `ProviderRegistryKernelServices` | Resolve a binding; throws when neither local bindings nor the kernel-services bus knows the abstract. |
| `setKernelContext(string $projectRoot, array $config, array $manifestFormatters): void` | `ProviderRegistry::discoverAndRegister()` | Inject project root, config, and manifest formatters before `register()`. |
| `setKernelServices(KernelServicesInterface): void` | `ProviderRegistry::discoverAndRegister()` | Inject the kernel-services bus before `register()`. |
| `getEntityTypeRegistrations(): list<array{entityType, registrant}>` | `ProviderRegistry::discoverAndRegister()` | Entity-type registrations contributed during `register()`. |

**Persistent-worker renderer ownership (#2064).** A fresh `HttpKernel` may be constructed for every request while multiple requests execute sequentially in one PHP worker process. `ThemeServiceProvider::register()` therefore constructs and publishes that provider instance's Twig environment before any provider `boot()` hook runs; `SsrServiceProvider` captures the same environment in its own provider instance, and its container bindings resolve that instance-owned value. Extension providers must never receive the static environment retained by an earlier kernel. The later Theme/SSR `boot()` hooks may finish wiring the current instance or support direct provider tests, but must not replace it with state from another request.

> **`routes()` runs once at boot — resolve request-scoped services lazily inside the handler, not at route-build (#1611).** `BuiltinRouteRegistrar::register()` calls every provider's `routes()` exactly once during kernel boot. Any controller you construct *inside* `routes()` — and any service that controller captures via `$this->resolve(...)` at that point — is built a single time and reused for the lifetime of the process. If a captured service is request-scoped or otherwise ephemeral (e.g. `DatabaseInterface` / a connection that is replaced per request), the controller will keep using the stale boot-time instance and its **writes can be silently lost**. Do **not** resolve and `new` controllers eagerly in `routes()` when they depend on request-scoped state. Instead defer construction so resolution happens per dispatch: register a closure controller that resolves dependencies when the route is matched. See `Waaseyaa\AI\Agent\Routing\AgentRouteServiceProvider` for the canonical lazy-factory pattern (`$factory = fn() => $this->buildController();` wired into each route's controller callable). The eager style in `Waaseyaa\Routing\AuthOidcRouteServiceProvider` is only safe because the controllers it builds do not capture request-scoped DB state.

**Tier 2 — abstract `ServiceProvider` capability methods.** Empty after mission #824 WP03 surfaces D–I lifted every kernel-invoked hook into a capability interface. New kernel-invoked hooks should enter as capability interfaces, never as no-op defaults on the abstract base. The contract test's `ABSTRACT_BASE_ONLY` allowlist enforces the empty invariant.

**Tier 3 — capability interfaces (`instanceof`-guarded).** A provider opts in by implementing the named interface; the call site (kernel for foundation-owned hooks, the owning subsystem's bootstrap for cross-package hooks) checks `instanceof` before calling. The contract test's `CAPABILITY_INTERFACES` allowlist names which method belongs to which interface.

| Method | Capability interface | Caller |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| `stripLanguagePrefixForRouting(string): string` | `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Http\LanguagePathStripperInterface` | `HttpKernel::stripLanguagePrefixForHttpRouting()` |
| `graphqlMutationOverrides(EntityTypeManager): array<string, array{args?, resolve?}>` | `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability\HasGraphqlMutationOverridesInterface` | `Waaseyaa\GraphQL\GraphQlServiceProvider::httpDomainRouters()` |
| `nativeCommands(): list<CommandDefinition>` | `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability\HasNativeCommandsInterface` | `ConsoleKernel::handle()` via `CliKernel` |
| `registerRenderCacheListeners(EventDispatcherInterface, ?CacheBackendInterface): void` | `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability\HasRenderCacheListenersInterface` | `HttpKernel::finalizeBoot()` |
| `configureHttpKernel(HttpKernel): void` | `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability\ConfiguresHttpKernelInterface` | `HttpKernel::finalizeBoot()` |
| `middleware(EntityTypeManager): list<HttpMiddlewareInterface>` | `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability\HasMiddlewareInterface` | `HttpKernel::buildMiddlewarePipeline()` |
| `httpDomainRouters(HttpKernel): iterable<DomainRouterInterface>` | `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability\HasHttpDomainRoutersInterface` | `HttpKernel::buildDomainRouterChain()` |
| `withMigrationProviders(list<object>): void` | `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability\AcceptsMigrationProvidersInterface` | `AbstractKernel::injectMigrationProviders()` |

The `withMigrationProviders` hook lets the kernel hand the discovered migration providers (objects exposing application migrations, found via the Layer-3 `HasMigrationsInterface`) to the provider that owns the migration registry, before that provider's `boot()` resolves the registry. The capability interface lives in Foundation so the kernel guards the call site with a named interface (not a concrete FQCN) while the Layer-3 migration `ServiceProvider` opts in via a downward dependency; the interface param is `list<object>` and the implementation filters to migration providers.

### ServiceProvider kernel-services bus

Service providers receive a typed bus of kernel-owned services through `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\KernelServicesInterface` (Contract A from mission #824 WP02). The interface declares a single method:

```php
public function get(string $abstract): ?object;
```

`KernelServicesInterface` replaces the legacy `\Closure(string): ?object` field that providers previously received via `setKernelResolver()`. The named contract makes the kernel surface explicit, restores PHPStan-visible types at the call boundary, and gives test doubles a stable seam.

**Wiring.** `ProviderRegistry` constructs one `ProviderRegistryKernelServices` instance per registration pass and hands it to every discovered provider via `ServiceProvider::setKernelServices()`. The default implementation resolves these abstracts:

| Abstract | Resolves to |
|----------|-------------|
| `Waaseyaa\Entity\EntityTypeManager` | The kernel’s entity-type manager |
| `Waaseyaa\Entity\Field\FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface` | The exact canonical registry already owned by the kernel's concrete `EntityTypeManager`; `null` for a bare/unit-constructed manager with no registry (#2047) |
| `Waaseyaa\Database\DatabaseInterface` | The kernel’s `DBALDatabase` |
| `Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface` | The kernel’s event dispatcher |
| `Psr\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface` | The same event dispatcher instance (G-025 / #1940) |
| `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Event\EventDispatcherInterface` | The same event dispatcher instance, guarded by `instanceof` since the property's declared type doesn't statically guarantee it (G-025 / #1940) |
| `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Log\LoggerInterface` | The kernel’s logger |
| `\PDO` | The native PDO connection beneath `DBALDatabase` |
| `Waaseyaa\Access\Gate\GateInterface` | A shared `EntityAccessGate` wrapping the kernel's `EntityAccessHandler` (G-014 / #1940) — memoized per handler instance. Resolves `null` before `AbstractKernel::discoverAccessPolicies()` has run (the handler accessor is not yet available), matching the existing `EntityAccessHandler::class` case's degrade-to-null behaviour. |
| anything else | The first sibling provider whose `getBindings()` declares the abstract, or `null` |

The provider list is read through a closure accessor so resolution sees the live registration state — necessary when a provider’s `register()` resolves a binding declared by a sibling registered earlier in the same pass.

**Resolution order in `ServiceProvider::resolve()`.** Local bindings (`singleton`/`bind`) win first; only when the abstract is unbound locally does the provider delegate to `KernelServicesInterface::get()`; if that returns `null`, the provider throws `RuntimeException("No binding registered for {$abstract}.")`.

**Hardcoded bus cases shadow sibling-provider bindings.** Inside `ProviderRegistryKernelServices::get()`, every abstract in the table above (including `GateInterface`, G-014, and `FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface`, #2047) is checked and returned BEFORE the fallthrough loop over sibling providers' `getBindings()` ever runs — the loop is only reached for abstracts none of the named cases matched. A host provider that binds one of these abstracts intending it to be resolvable by sibling providers through the bus is shadowed: every bus consumer still gets the kernel-owned service. In particular, the existing duplicate `FieldServiceProvider` registry binding is shadowed for sibling consumers; removing or reconciling that duplicate is a documented follow-up and is not required for #2047 because the real kernel path proves the canonical manager registry is authoritative. This does not affect resolution *within* the host provider itself — `ServiceProvider::resolve()`'s local-bindings-first rule (previous paragraph) still means a provider resolving an abstract it bound locally gets its own binding, never the bus. The shadowing only applies to *other* providers resolving that abstract through `KernelServicesInterface::get()`.

**Propagation through `mergeChildProvider()`.** When a stack provider merges a child via `mergeChildProvider()`, the child receives the same `KernelServicesInterface` instance so `resolve()` keeps working inside the child’s `register()`.

### HTTP service resolver (SSR controller-method DI)

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-07 - foundation-symfony-fallback-elimination-01KQZR1 WP03–WP04: resolver + routing exceptions + RouteBuilder/_controller normalization -->

`HttpKernel::getHttpServiceResolver()` returns `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Http\HttpServiceResolverInterface` (default impl `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Kernel\Http\HttpKernelServiceResolver`). SSR uses this seam to satisfy app-controller method dependencies — given a class name from a `\ReflectionNamedType` parameter, the resolver returns an instance or `null`. Replaces the legacy `\Closure(string): ?object` shape; mirrors the typed-resolver pattern introduced for `KernelServicesInterface` above. The default resolver walks provider bindings first; the narrow `DatabaseInterface` fallback delegates to the same `KernelServicesInterface` implementation used at bootstrap (`ProviderRegistryKernelServices`), not a second hard-coded map.

`HttpServiceResolverInterface` is intentionally separate from `KernelServicesInterface`: the latter is finite, kernel-internal, and provider-scoped, while this surface is open-ended and driven by user-authored controller signatures. Naming the seam allows future tightening (allowed-types enforcement, caching, tracing) without affecting the kernel-services bus.

**Routing miss surface.** `Waaseyaa\Routing\WaaseyaaRouter::match()` wraps Symfony `UrlMatcher` failures as `Waaseyaa\Routing\Exception\RouteNotFoundException` and `RouteMethodNotAllowedException` so `HttpKernel` handles 404/405 without importing `Symfony\Component\Routing\Exception\*` for expected misses.

**`_controller` shape.** Symfony `Route` defaults may use `[FQCN, method]`; `RouteBuilder::controller()` normalizes that to `FQCN::method`, and `HttpKernel` applies `RouteBuilder::normalizeControllerDefault()` when copying matcher parameters onto the request so `ControllerDispatcher` always sees a string or invokable for `_controller`.

### HTTP error surface (JSON-first)

Machine clients (Admin SPA, MCP, curl scripts) should assume **JSON:API-shaped errors** unless they explicitly negotiated HTML.

| Phase | Content-Type | When |
|-------|----------------|------|
| Boot failure (non-debug) | `application/vnd.api+json` | `HttpKernel::handle()` catch around `boot()` — `bootFailureJsonResponse()` uses `clientSafeBootFailureDetail()` so JSON `errors[].detail` names known cases (e.g. debug-in-production guard, missing production SQLite, PHPUnit on production autoload) without echoing filesystem paths; the matching `logger->critical` boot line still carries the full message and trace |
| Unhandled exception after successful boot | `application/vnd.api+json` | Outer `handle()` catch — generic 500 JSON:API body |
| Controller pipeline | JSON:API or negotiated Inertia/SSR | `ControllerDispatcher` and domain routers |

**Policy:** New HTTP surfaces must not introduce ad-hoc HTML error snippets for API-shaped routes. SSR and browser-document routes may return HTML via dedicated renderers. MCP stays on JSON-RPC as defined in `docs/specs/mcp-endpoint.md` — boot failures still pass through `HttpKernel` first, so MCP inherits the same boot behavior as other routes until the kernel is healthy.

### Testing fixture factories (`packages/testing/`)

`EntityFactory` remains the lightweight defaults/overrides + sequence helper for value arrays.
`EntityTypeFixtureValues` adds metadata-aware dummy generation for tests/seeds by reading
`EntityTypeValidationConstraints::forEntityType()` from `waaseyaa/entity`, so generated values
follow the same merged field-definition + manual constraint map used by `EntityRepository` save
validation. This is explicitly a fixture path (not production hydration via `EntityInstantiator`).

## Domain Events

### DomainEvent base class

File: `packages/foundation/src/Event/DomainEvent.php`

```php
namespace Waaseyaa\Foundation\Event;

abstract class DomainEvent extends Event
{
    public readonly string $eventId;          // UUIDv7, auto-generated
    public readonly \DateTimeImmutable $occurredAt;  // auto-set to now

    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $aggregateType,   // e.g., 'node', 'user', 'config'
        public readonly string $aggregateId,     // entity ID or config name
        public readonly ?string $tenantId = null,
        public readonly ?string $actorId = null,
    );

    abstract public function getPayload(): array;
}
```

All properties are `public readonly`. There are no getter methods.

### Event dispatch

Domain events use Symfony's `EventDispatcherInterface` directly. There is no custom EventBus wrapper. Service providers register listeners via `$dispatcher->addListener()` or `$dispatcher->addSubscriber()`.

Real-time SSE delivery to the admin SPA is handled by the durable-log path: `EventListenerRegistrar::registerBroadcastListeners` subscribes to entity `post_save`/`post_delete` and writes rows into `BroadcastStorage` (DB-backed). `BroadcastRouter` polls that store for the `/broadcast` endpoint. See `docs/specs/broadcasting.md` for the full contract.

### Best-effort side effects

Event listeners for non-critical operations (broadcasting, logging, cache invalidation) must wrap in try-catch and log via `LoggerInterface` to avoid crashing the primary request. The project does not use `psr/log`; use `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Log\LoggerInterface` with `NullLogger` as the default fallback. Reserve `error_log()` only for last-resort fallbacks inside the logging infrastructure itself.

## Cache System

### Process-lifetime structural cache boundary

Request-reachable process statics remain deny-by-default under
`tools/access-hardening-baseline.php`. A reviewed structural cache must be
bounded, keyed by every input that can change its result, and hold only immutable
construction data. A cache hit must rebind or clone that data into the current
kernel/registry generation; a changed key must miss, and a stale generation must
fail closed rather than fall back to older authority.

The retained #2064 caches satisfy that rule narrowly: entity classification
blueprints are rebound to fresh generation seals, and JSON:API structural route
templates are cloned into fresh routers. Neither cache may retain requests,
accounts/principals, entities or values, access decisions, capabilities, audit
records, providers, services, runtime-bound controllers, routers, matchers,
generators, or mutable route collections.

### CacheBackendInterface

File: `packages/cache/src/CacheBackendInterface.php`

```php
namespace Waaseyaa\Cache;

interface CacheBackendInterface
{
    public const PERMANENT = -1;

    public function get(string $cid): CacheItem|false;
    public function getMultiple(array &$cids): array;   // pass-by-reference; $cids narrowed to misses
    public function set(string $cid, mixed $data, int $expire = self::PERMANENT, array $tags = []): void;
    public function delete(string $cid): void;
    public function deleteMultiple(array $cids): void;
    public function deleteAll(): void;
    public function invalidate(string $cid): void;       // marks invalid but does not delete
    public function invalidateMultiple(array $cids): void;
    public function invalidateAll(): void;
    public function removeBin(): void;                   // drops the entire bin
}
```

### CacheItem

File: `packages/cache/src/CacheItem.php`

```php
final readonly class CacheItem
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $cid,
        public mixed $data,
        public int $created,
        public int $expire = CacheBackendInterface::PERMANENT,
        public array $tags = [],
        public bool $valid = true,
    ) {}
}
```

### TagAwareCacheInterface

File: `packages/cache/src/TagAwareCacheInterface.php`

Extends `CacheBackendInterface` with:

```php
interface TagAwareCacheInterface extends CacheBackendInterface
{
    /** @param string[] $tags */
    public function invalidateByTags(array $tags): void;
}
```

### Backend implementations

| Backend | File | Tag-aware | Notes |
|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| `MemoryBackend` | `packages/cache/src/Backend/MemoryBackend.php` | Yes | In-memory array; use for tests. Implements `TagAwareCacheInterface`. |
| `DatabaseBackend` | `packages/cache/src/Backend/DatabaseBackend.php` | Yes | PDO-backed; auto-creates table on first use. `INSERT OR REPLACE`. Tags stored comma-separated. |
| `NullBackend` | `packages/cache/src/Backend/NullBackend.php` | No | All gets return false; all writes are no-ops. Use for disabled bins. |

### CacheFactory and CacheConfiguration

File: `packages/cache/src/CacheFactory.php`, `packages/cache/src/CacheConfiguration.php`

```php
interface CacheFactoryInterface
{
    public function get(string $bin): CacheBackendInterface;
}
```

`CacheFactory` creates backends per bin. `CacheConfiguration` maps bin names to backend classes or factory callables. Factory callables take precedence over class names for backends that need constructor arguments (e.g., DatabaseBackend needs a `\PDO`).

```php
$config = new CacheConfiguration(
    defaultBackend: MemoryBackend::class,
    binFactories: [
        'cache_entity' => fn() => new DatabaseBackend($pdo, 'cache_entity'),
    ],
);
$factory = new CacheFactory($config);
$cache = $factory->get('cache_entity');  // returns DatabaseBackend
$cache = $factory->get('cache_other');   // returns MemoryBackend
```

### Tag invalidation

File: `packages/cache/src/CacheTagsInvalidator.php`

`CacheTagsInvalidator` holds references to all registered cache bins and delegates `invalidateTags()` to those that implement `TagAwareCacheInterface`.

### Cache event listeners

| Listener | File | Listens to | Tags invalidated |
|----------|------|-----------|------------------|
| `EntityCacheInvalidator` | `packages/cache/src/Listener/EntityCacheInvalidator.php` | `EntityEvent` (post-save, post-delete, `EntityEvents::REVISION_REVERTED`) + `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Event\RevisionPointerMovedEvent` (CW-v1 WP-2 task 2.5, #1920 — pointer moves via `setCurrentRevision()`/`setPublishedRevision()`/`rollback()`'s revert signal previously invalidated no cache tags at all) | `entity:{type}`, `entity:{type}:{id}` (built directly from the event's `entityTypeId`/`entityId` for the pointer-move path — no entity load needed) |
| `ConfigCacheInvalidator` | `packages/cache/src/Listener/ConfigCacheInvalidator.php` | `ConfigEvent` (post-save, post-delete) | `config`, `config:{name}` |
| `TranslationCacheInvalidator` | `packages/cache/src/Listener/TranslationCacheInvalidator.php` | Translation events | Translation-specific tags |

### Cache initialization timing in HttpKernel

Cache setup follows a two-stage lifecycle:

1. **Boot phase** (`AbstractKernel::boot()`): Core services are initialized (database, config, entity type manager, dispatcher, access handler). No cache bins or cache-related objects are created yet.

2. **Handle phase** (`HttpKernel::handle()`, after `boot()` returns):
   - `CacheConfigResolver` is instantiated with the loaded config array.
   - `CacheConfiguration` is created and bin factories are registered for `render`, `discovery`, and `mcp_read` bins (all database-backed).
   - `CacheFactory` creates the three cache backends.
   - `RenderCache` wraps the render backend; `discoveryCache` and `mcpReadCache` are stored as `CacheBackendInterface` references.
   - `EventListenerRegistrar` registers invalidation listeners in this order:
     1. `registerRenderCacheListeners(renderCache)`
     2. `registerDiscoveryCacheListeners(discoveryCache)`
     3. `registerMcpReadCacheListeners(mcpReadCache)`
   - All three listener methods subscribe to `EntityEvents::POST_SAVE->value` and `EntityEvents::POST_DELETE->value` (the string-backed enum values from `Waaseyaa\Entity\Event\EntityEvents`, e.g. `'waaseyaa.entity.post_save'`).

This means `CacheConfigResolver` is **not** available during boot — it requires the config array which is populated by boot, and is only needed by the SSR page handler created later in `handle()`.

### Atomic file writes pattern

Cache files and compiled artifacts must use write-to-temp-then-rename to prevent serving partial writes:

```php
$tmpPath = $cachePath . '.tmp.' . getmypid();
file_put_contents($tmpPath, $content);
rename($tmpPath, $cachePath);
```

This pattern is used in `PackageManifestCompiler::compileAndCache()` and must be used anywhere the cache system writes PHP files to disk.

Attribute instances built via `ReflectionAttribute::newInstance()` — used throughout `PackageManifestCompiler` for `AsFormatter`, `AsMiddleware`, `AsEntityType`, etc. — reflect their constructor declarations verbatim. Required typed properties are guaranteed initialized, so `isset()` / `??` guards on them are dead code; PHPStan flags them as `isset.property` / `nullCoalesce.property`. Gate on `!== ''` (or an explicit nullability check against the declared type) instead.

## Database Layer

### DatabaseInterface

File: `packages/database-legacy/src/DatabaseInterface.php`

```php
namespace Waaseyaa\Database;

interface DatabaseInterface
{
    public function select(string $table, string $alias = ''): SelectInterface;
    public function insert(string $table): InsertInterface;
    public function update(string $table): UpdateInterface;
    public function delete(string $table): DeleteInterface;
    public function schema(): SchemaInterface;
    public function transaction(string $name = ''): TransactionInterface;
    public function query(string $sql, array $args = []): \Traversable;
}
```

**CRITICAL**: `DatabaseInterface` does NOT have `getConnection()`. If the DBAL `Connection` is needed, type-hint `DBALDatabase` directly. Prefer using the query builder (`select()`, `insert()`, `update()`, `delete()`) over raw DBAL.

### DBALDatabase

File: `packages/database-legacy/src/DBALDatabase.php`

```php
final class DBALDatabase implements DatabaseInterface
{
    public function __construct(private readonly Connection $connection);
    public static function createSqlite(string $path = ':memory:'): self;
    public function getConnection(): Connection;   // ONLY on DBALDatabase, NOT on DatabaseInterface
}
```

`DBALDatabase` wraps a Doctrine DBAL `Connection`. The `createSqlite()` factory enables foreign-key enforcement on every new connection before any schema or data work, and enables WAL mode for non-memory databases. Query results use `fetchAssociative()` (equivalent to FETCH_ASSOC — no duplicate numeric-indexed columns).

### TransactionInterface

File: `packages/database-legacy/src/TransactionInterface.php`

```php
interface TransactionInterface
{
    public function commit(): void;
    public function rollBack(): void;
}
```

`DBALTransaction` begins the transaction in its constructor. Calling `commit()` or `rollBack()` after the transaction is no longer active throws `\RuntimeException`.

## Query Builder

### SelectInterface

File: `packages/database-legacy/src/SelectInterface.php`

```php
interface SelectInterface
{
    public function fields(string $tableAlias, array $fields = []): static;
    public function addField(string $tableAlias, string $field, string $alias = ''): static;
    public function condition(string $field, mixed $value, string $operator = '='): static; // $field auto-quoted (WP6)
    public function isNull(string $field): static;       // $field auto-quoted (WP6)
    public function isNotNull(string $field): static;    // $field auto-quoted (WP6)
    public function orderBy(string $field, string $direction = 'ASC'): static; // $field auto-quoted (WP6)
    public function whereRaw(string $expression, array $parameters = []): static;   // verbatim + bound `?` params (WP6)
    public function orderByRaw(string $expression, string $direction): static;       // verbatim (WP6)
    public function range(int $offset, int $limit): static;
    public function join(string $table, string $alias, string $condition): static;
    public function leftJoin(string $table, string $alias, string $condition): static;
    public function countQuery(): static;  // clones + wraps in COUNT(*)
    public function execute(): \Traversable;
}
```

### DBALSelect condition operators

File: `packages/database-legacy/src/Query/DBALSelect.php`

Supported operators in `condition()`:
- `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` -- standard comparison, single `?` placeholder
- `IN`, `NOT IN` -- value must be array, generates `(?, ?, ...)` placeholders
- `BETWEEN` -- value must be array of exactly 2
- `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE` -- appends `ESCAPE '\'` automatically
- `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL` -- use `isNull()`/`isNotNull()` methods instead

**LIKE wildcard escaping**: When building LIKE patterns in application code (e.g., `SqlEntityQuery`), escape `%` and `_` in user input:
```php
$escaped = str_replace(['%', '_'], ['\\%', '\\_'], $userInput);
$query->condition('title', '%' . $escaped . '%', 'LIKE');
```

All conditions are ANDed together. No OR support at this level.

`IN`/`NOT IN` lists infer DBAL's array type from their first element:
integer and boolean lists use `ArrayParameterType::INTEGER`; other and empty
lists use `ArrayParameterType::STRING`. Scalar floats bind explicitly as
strings because DBAL exposes no float `ParameterType`, preserving the decimal
value for platform conversion rather than relying on an implicit default.

### Identifier quoting (SQL-injection hardening — database-legacy M1+M2, fully closed WP6 #1816)

The query builder binds all **values** as parameters (never interpolated), so `$value` is never an injection vector. **Identifiers** (column / alias / table / join names) and **raw expressions** are handled as follows:

- **Builder-owned identifier paths are quoted** via the platform's `quoteIdentifier` (cross-driver; splits a qualified `alias.column` on `.` and quotes each part; doubles embedded quotes so a reserved word like `key`/`count`/`order`, or a metacharacter-bearing name, is rendered inert): `fields()` / `addField()` columns and the `AS` alias, `join()` / `leftJoin()` `$table` and `$alias`, the WHERE-field of `DBALUpdate` / `DBALDelete`, and **(WP6)** the `$field` of `DBALSelect::condition()` / `orderBy()` / `isNull()` / `isNotNull()`. `*` in `fields()`/`addField()` is left unquoted. A caller may therefore pass a raw, unquoted column name (`order`, `count`) to these `Select` methods safely.
- **Raw-expression seams** `whereRaw(string $expression, array $parameters = [])` and `orderByRaw(string $expression, string $direction)` emit the expression **verbatim** with positional `?` parameters bound left-to-right (an array entry binds as a multi-value `IN` list). This is the only place a SQL *expression* (e.g. `json_extract(_data, '$.x')`, `COALESCE(a, 0)`, a `CAST` wrapper) may flow into a `Select` WHERE/ORDER BY — quoting an expression as an identifier would corrupt it. Same **developer-supplied-only** contract as the `join()` ON-condition: **never pass user input as `$expression`**; bind values through `?` + `$parameters`.
- **Entity read engine routing (WP6).** `SqlEntityQuery::resolveField()` and `SqlStorageDriver::resolveField()` now return a `ResolvedField` value object (`packages/entity-storage/src/ResolvedField.php`) carrying the SQL text plus shape (`isExpression()` / `isJsonExtract()`). A plain/qualified column is a **bare** identifier (no longer pre-quoted) routed through the auto-quoting `condition()`/`orderBy()`/`isNull()`/`isNotNull()` path; a `_data` `json_extract(...)` field is an **expression** routed through `whereRaw()`/`orderByRaw()`. The K3 native-type `CAST(json_extract(...) AS TEXT)` casting for `IN`/comparison on JSON `_data` fields (mission #1257 WP05) is preserved inside the `whereRaw()` path. Acceptance: `IdentifierQuotingTest` (reserved-word + metacharacter inert through every quoted path incl. `condition`/`orderBy`/`isNull`/`isNotNull`; `whereRaw`/`orderByRaw` verbatim + bound params) plus the entity-storage query suites (json_extract filter/sort + K3 casting still green via the raw seams).
- **Raw `PRAGMA` callers outside the query builder** must quote the same way. `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Diagnostic\HealthChecker`'s three `PRAGMA table_info(...)` probes (foundation, WP6 layer-gate scope batch) build the SQL string directly rather than going through `SelectInterface`, so they call `DatabaseInterface::quoteIdentifier($tableName)` themselves before interpolating — a hand-built `"{$tableName}"` literal does not double embedded `"` characters the way `quoteIdentifier()` does, so it is not equivalent. See `docs/specs/operator-diagnostics.md` "Schema Drift Detection".

## Discovery Response Caching (v1.0)

The HTTP kernel now maintains a dedicated `discovery` cache bin (database-backed, table `cache_discovery`) for anonymous public discovery API surfaces:

- `/api/discovery/hub/{entity_type}/{id}`
- `/api/discovery/cluster/{entity_type}/{id}`
- `/api/discovery/timeline/{entity_type}/{id}`
- `/api/discovery/endpoint/{entity_type}/{id}`

Cache key contract:

- Stable hash of `{surface, entity_type, entity_id, options}`.
- `options` are recursively normalized with deterministic associative-key sorting.
- Key dimensions include relationship filters, direction, temporal filters (`at/from/to`), pagination (`limit/offset`), and status mode.
- Shared primitive: `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Cache\DiscoveryCachePrimitives`.
- `DiscoveryCachePrimitives::CACHE_KEY_GENERATION` (private, embedded in the hashed key input, never surfaced in a response payload or cache tag) is bumped whenever an api-layer discovery-visibility fix narrows what a cached entry may disclose, so every pre-bump entry becomes an orphaned miss instead of being read back with stale, over-permissive data. Currently `3` (bumped 1->2 for the R7 WP2 endpoint-visibility access-awareness fix, 2->3 for the R8 WP2 source-entity view gate — see docs/specs/api-layer.md "Discovery API Handler").

Runtime behavior:

- Anonymous requests: cache read-through with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=120`.
- Cache hit header: `X-Waaseyaa-Discovery-Cache: HIT`.
- Cache miss header: `X-Waaseyaa-Discovery-Cache: MISS`.
- Authenticated requests bypass persistence and return `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.
- Discovery payloads carry a stable metadata envelope:
  - `meta.contract_version = v1.0`
  - `meta.contract_stability = stable`
  - `meta.surface = discovery_api` (default when not supplied by the caller)

Invalidation:

- Preferred path (tag-aware backends): targeted `invalidateByTags()` on save/delete using tags such as:
  - `discovery`
  - `discovery:entity:{type}`
  - `discovery:entity:{type}:{id}`
  - related-entity tags extracted from discovery payload edges/clusters/browse surfaces
  - plus broad discovery-surface tags for relationship/node graph-impact changes
- Fallback path (non tag-aware backends): `deleteAll()` for correctness.

## MCP Read-Path Caching (v1.1)

The HTTP kernel maintains a dedicated MCP read cache bin (database-backed, table `cache_mcp_read`) for read-heavy tool calls served by `Waaseyaa\Mcp\McpController`:

- `search_entities` / `search_teachings`
- `ai_discover`
- `traverse_relationships`
- `get_related_entities`
- `get_knowledge_graph`

Cache key contract:

- Stable hash of `{contract_version, tool, arguments, account_context}`.
- `arguments` are recursively normalized with deterministic associative-key sorting.
- `account_context` includes:
  - `authenticated` flag
  - account ID
  - sorted role list

This prevents cross-account and anonymous/authenticated cache leakage while preserving deterministic replay for identical callers and inputs.

Runtime behavior:

- Tool result payloads are cached with 120-second TTL.
- Payload contract remains unchanged (`meta.contract_version`, `meta.contract_stability`, tool metadata).
- Cache writes include tags:
  - `mcp_read`
  - `mcp_read:contract:v1.0`
  - `mcp_read:tool:{tool}`
  - entity tags extracted from arguments/payload (`mcp_read:entity:{type}` and `mcp_read:entity:{type}:{id}`).

Invalidation:

- Preferred path (tag-aware backends): targeted `invalidateByTags()` on entity save/delete:
  - `mcp_read`
  - `mcp_read:entity:{type}`
  - `mcp_read:entity:{type}:{id}`
- Fallback path (non tag-aware backends): `deleteAll()`.

## SSR Render Cache Variant Contract (v1.2)

SSR render cache keys include a deterministic variant suffix built from:

- language (`langcode`)
- view mode (`view_mode`)
- preview/public mode (`preview`)
- workflow state (`workflow_visibility.state`)
- graph-context hash (normalized `relationship_navigation`)
- HTML page composition (absent for the legacy/no-binding case, or
  deterministic hashes of the registered `EntityPageComposerInterface`
  implementation class and normalized inbound request path)
- contract version

The variant payload is normalized and hashed, then emitted with a readable prefix:

- `v2:{langcode}:{view_mode}:{public|preview}:{workflow_state}:{hash}`

This hardens cache partitioning and prevents future cache-key ambiguity while preserving deterministic replay under equivalent context inputs.

Security boundary:

- preview requests and public requests resolve to distinct variant keys,
- preview render paths are not persisted to shared public cache storage,
- public cache reads/writes remain restricted to unauthenticated, non-preview requests.
- Markdown ignores composer identity and keeps its independent representation
  variant because page composition is an HTML-only contract.
- A composer exception or invalid response falls back to framework rendering
  as `private, no-store`, without surrogate keys or a render-cache write; a
  deliberate `null` composer decline is deterministic and remains cacheable
  in the registered composer's class-and-path variant.
- Accepted composed documents are also `private, no-store`, have no public
  surrogate keys, and are not written to `RenderCache`: application chrome
  dependencies are opaque to the entity-only tagging model. Shared caching
  requires a future explicit dependency-metadata contract.
- With no composer binding, the pre-contract HTML variant payload and complete
  hash remain byte-for-byte unchanged.
- `HttpKernelServiceResolver` exposes a non-instantiating binding probe and a
  failure-propagating bound resolution path. This preserves zero field
  formatting on a legacy cache hit, exactly one formatting pass on a miss,
  runs an application composer factory only after the authorized payload is
  built, and distinguishes a missing binding from a broken factory.
- Registered composer decline/failure fallback reuses the one request-local
  authorized formatter result through a private handler-only path; no public
  caller-supplied render-bag API exists.

`RenderCache::SCHEMA_VERSION` is `v6` for the page-composition contract. This
makes every pre-contract `v5` document unreachable and prevents cached generic
framework HTML from surviving the first deployment that registers an
application shell. See [ssr-page-composition.md](./ssr-page-composition.md).

Render cache invalidation is broadened for relationship-aware pages:

- entity-specific invalidation still occurs on save/delete,
- when `node` or `relationship` entities change, type-wide node/relationship render tags are invalidated to prevent stale relationship-navigation output.

## Public SSR CDN Strategy (v1.4)

Public SSR routes now expose deterministic HTTP cache profiles aligned with workflow and graph-context invariants:

- `Cache-Control` for anonymous/public SSR responses:
  - `public, max-age={cache_max_age}, s-maxage={cache_shared_max_age}, stale-while-revalidate={cache_stale_while_revalidate}, stale-if-error={cache_stale_if_error}`
- Authenticated SSR responses remain private:
  - `private, no-store`

Default values when no explicit config is provided:

- `cache_max_age`: `300`
- `cache_shared_max_age`: fallback to `cache_max_age`
- `cache_stale_while_revalidate`: `60`
- `cache_stale_if_error`: `600`

### Surrogate-key contract

Public SSR entity responses also emit CDN-oriented surrogate keys:

- `Surrogate-Key` includes:
  - `waaseyaa:ssr`
  - entity scope: `waaseyaa:ssr:entity:{type}` and `waaseyaa:ssr:entity:{type}:{id}`
  - workflow scope: `waaseyaa:ssr:workflow:{workflow_state}`
  - view/lang scope: `waaseyaa:ssr:view:{view_mode}`, `waaseyaa:ssr:lang:{langcode}`
  - graph scope: `waaseyaa:ssr:graph:{graph_hash}`
- Debug/trace headers:
  - `X-Waaseyaa-Render-Variant`
  - `X-Waaseyaa-Render-Workflow`

### Invalidation behavior

SSR cache invalidation remains workflow/graph-aware and deterministic:

- save/delete of the rendered entity invalidates its entity-specific SSR cache entries,
- save/delete of `node` and `relationship` entities triggers broader invalidation for relationship-aware public surfaces,
- emitted surrogate keys are aligned with these invariants so CDN purge tooling can target entity/workflow/graph scopes without contract drift.

### InsertInterface

File: `packages/database-legacy/src/InsertInterface.php`

```php
interface InsertInterface
{
    public function fields(array $fields): static;      // column names
    public function values(array $values): static;      // can be called multiple times for batch
    public function execute(): int|string;              // returns lastInsertId
}
```

If `fields()` is not called, field names are inferred from the first `values()` call's array keys. Indexed arrays require prior `fields()` call.

### UpdateInterface

File: `packages/database-legacy/src/UpdateInterface.php`

```php
interface UpdateInterface
{
    public function fields(array $fields): static;      // ['column' => value]
    public function condition(string $field, mixed $value, string $operator = '='): static;
    public function execute(): int;                     // returns affected row count
}
```

### DeleteInterface

File: `packages/database-legacy/src/DeleteInterface.php`

```php
interface DeleteInterface
{
    public function condition(string $field, mixed $value, string $operator = '='): static;
    public function execute(): int;                     // returns affected row count
}
```

### Usage examples

```php
// Select with join
$results = $db->select('node', 'n')
    ->fields('n', ['nid', 'title'])
    ->leftJoin('node_field_data', 'nfd', 'n.nid = nfd.nid')
    ->condition('n.type', 'article')
    ->orderBy('n.created', 'DESC')
    ->range(0, 10)
    ->execute();

// Insert
$db->insert('users')
    ->values(['uid' => 1, 'name' => 'admin', 'mail' => 'admin@example.com'])
    ->execute();

// Update
$affected = $db->update('users')
    ->fields(['name' => 'superadmin'])
    ->condition('uid', 1)
    ->execute();

// Delete
$affected = $db->delete('sessions')
    ->condition('expire', time(), '<')
    ->execute();

// Transaction
$txn = $db->transaction();
try {
    $db->insert('audit_log')->values([...])->execute();
    $txn->commit();
} catch (\Throwable $e) {
    $txn->rollBack();
    throw $e;
}
```

## Schema System

### SchemaInterface (database DDL)

File: `packages/database-legacy/src/SchemaInterface.php`

```php
interface SchemaInterface
{
    public function tableExists(string $table): bool;
    public function fieldExists(string $table, string $field): bool;
    public function createTable(string $name, array $spec): void;
    public function dropTable(string $table): void;
    public function addField(string $table, string $field, array $spec): void;
    public function dropField(string $table, string $field): void;
    public function addIndex(string $table, string $name, array $fields): void;
    public function dropIndex(string $table, string $name): void;
    public function addUniqueKey(string $table, string $name, array $fields): void;
    public function addPrimaryKey(string $table, array $fields): void;
}
```

`DBALSchema` uses Doctrine DBAL's schema introspection and DDL generation. Type mapping: `serial` -> INTEGER AUTOINCREMENT, `varchar` -> TEXT, `int`/`integer` -> INTEGER, `text` -> TEXT, `float`/`numeric`/`decimal` -> REAL, `blob` -> BLOB.

`addPrimaryKey()` uses Doctrine's portable schema comparator and generated
ALTER statements on capable platforms. SQLite cannot add a primary key to an
existing table, so that platform retains a clear `\RuntimeException` requiring
the key to be declared at table creation.

**Distinction from SchemaPresenter**: `SchemaInterface` is a database DDL abstraction in `packages/database-legacy/` for creating/altering tables. It is unrelated to `SchemaPresenter` (`packages/api/src/Schema/SchemaPresenter.php`), which generates JSON Schema output from entity field definitions for the API layer. `SchemaPresenter` works with `EntityType::getFieldDefinitions()` and does not use `SchemaInterface`.

### SchemaRegistryInterface (ingestion payload schemas)

File: `packages/foundation/src/Schema/SchemaRegistryInterface.php`

```php
interface SchemaRegistryInterface
{
    /** @return list<SchemaEntry> Schemas sorted by entity type ID */
    public function list(): array;

    public function get(string $id): ?SchemaEntry;
}
```

Registry of JSON Schema definitions used to validate ingestion payloads. `DefaultsSchemaRegistry` loads schemas from the `defaults/` directory and caches them on first access. Consumers use this interface when they need to look up or enumerate available payload schemas — for example, the `SchemaListCommand` CLI command and `PayloadValidator`.

**Note:** This is the ingestion schema registry, not the database DDL schema system above. See `docs/specs/ingestion-defaults.md` for ingestion contract details.

## Migration System

The migration system uses Doctrine DBAL (same as the database layer). It lives in `packages/foundation/src/Migration/`.

### Migration base class

File: `packages/foundation/src/Migration/Migration.php`

```php
abstract class Migration
{
    public array $after = [];  // package names this migration must run after

    abstract public function up(SchemaBuilder $schema): void;
    public function down(SchemaBuilder $schema): void {}  // optional rollback
}
```

### SchemaBuilder

File: `packages/foundation/src/Migration/SchemaBuilder.php`

Uses Doctrine DBAL `Connection` + `Schema`. Creates tables via `TableBuilder` closure pattern:

```php
$schema->create('nodes', function (TableBuilder $table) {
    $table->id();                           // string('id', 128)
    $table->string('type', 64);
    $table->text('title');
    $table->json('_data')->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();                   // created + changed timestamps
    $table->primary(['id']);
    $table->index(['type']);
});
```

Other `SchemaBuilder` methods: `drop()`, `dropIfExists()`, `hasTable()`, `hasColumn()`.

### TableBuilder column types

File: `packages/foundation/src/Migration/TableBuilder.php`

| Method | Column Type | Doctrine Type |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| `id(name)` | `string(name, 128)` | STRING |
| `string(name, length)` | varchar | STRING |
| `text(name)` | text | TEXT |
| `integer(name)` | integer | INTEGER |
| `boolean(name)` | boolean | BOOLEAN |
| `float(name)` | float | FLOAT |
| `json(name)` | json | JSON |
| `timestamp(name)` | datetime_immutable | DATETIME_IMMUTABLE |

Convenience methods: `timestamps()` (creates `created` + `changed`), `entityBase()` (id + entity_type + bundle + _data + timestamps), `translationColumns()` (langcode + default_langcode + translation_source), `revisionColumns()` (revision_id + revision_created + revision_log).

For multi-bundle entity types with bundle-scoped fields, `SqlSchemaHandler` additionally provisions `{base_table}__{bundle}` subtables (1:1 with the base, FK `ON DELETE CASCADE`). `SqlEntityStorage` partitions values by `FieldDefinition::$targetBundle` on save and two-query-loads (base row first, subtable by PK). `SqlEntityQuery` injects INNER JOINs for bundle-scoped conditions. See [`bundle-scoped-storage.md`](./bundle-scoped-storage.md) for the full contract.

### ColumnDefinition

File: `packages/foundation/src/Migration/ColumnDefinition.php`

Fluent modifiers: `->nullable()`, `->default(value)`, `->unique()`.

### Migrator

File: `packages/foundation/src/Migration/Migrator.php`

```php
final class Migrator
{
    public function __construct(Connection $connection, MigrationRepository $repository);

    /** @param array<string, array<string, Migration>> $migrations  package => [name => Migration] */
    public function run(array $migrations): MigrationResult;
    public function rollback(array $migrations): MigrationResult;
    public function status(array $migrations): array;  // ['pending' => [...], 'completed' => [...]]
}
```

Migrations are topologically sorted by `Migration::$after` dependencies. Each batch gets an incrementing batch number. Rollback undoes the last batch in reverse order.

### MigrationRepository

File: `packages/foundation/src/Migration/MigrationRepository.php`

Tracks executed migrations in the `waaseyaa_migrations` table:
- `id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- `migration` VARCHAR(255) -- migration name
- `package` VARCHAR(128) -- originating package
- `batch` INTEGER -- batch number
- `ran_at` TIMESTAMP

### MigrationResult

File: `packages/foundation/src/Migration/MigrationResult.php`

```php
final readonly class MigrationResult
{
    public function __construct(
        public int $count,
        public array $migrations = [],
    ) {}
}
```

### Package-declared migrations (`extra.waaseyaa.migrations`)

Packages ship SQL DDL migrations under a **single directory** registered in `composer.json`:

```json
"extra": {
    "waaseyaa": {
        "migrations": "migrations"
    }
}
```

`PackageManifestCompiler` copies `packageName => relativePath` into `PackageManifest::$migrations`. `MigrationLoader` resolves the directory (vendor install path or monorepo path), loads every `*.php` file in **lexicographic filename order**, and requires each file to return a `Migration` instance. Migration identity in the ledger is `"{package}:{filename_without_extension}"` (e.g. `waaseyaa/oidc:2026_04_26_000001_oidc_client_schema`).

**Ordering:** Prefer numeric or ISO-date prefixes in filenames so `glob` + `sort` order matches intended apply order. Use `Migration::$after` with **Composer package names** when one package’s migrations must run after another’s (see `Migrator::topologicalSort()`).

#### v2 array form (mission #529 / WP11)

Per spec §15 Q9, `extra.waaseyaa.migrations` also accepts an **ordered list** of mixed FQCN namespace prefixes and path strings, enabling packages that ship v2 migrations (`MigrationInterfaceV2`) alongside (or instead of) legacy directory-based ones:

```json
"extra": {
    "waaseyaa": {
        "migrations": [
            "Vendor\\Pkg\\Migrations\\v2",
            "../patches/v2"
        ]
    }
}
```

`PackageManifestCompiler::validateMigrationsEntry()` rejects malformed entries (associative arrays, non-string elements, non-string-or-array top-level values) with stable code `INVALID_MIGRATION_ENTRY` (`InvalidMigrationEntryException`). `MigrationLoader` exposes two methods that walk the same manifest in order: `loadAll()` resolves path entries to legacy `Migration` instances; `loadAllV2()` resolves FQCN entries via Composer's classmap to `MigrationInterfaceV2` instances. The string form (`"migrations": "migrations"`) is preserved indefinitely (Q9 — no removal date) and is internally normalised to a single-element list.

**Entry classification heuristic (v1):** entries containing a backslash are FQCN namespace prefixes; everything else is a path string. Full discovery rules — including the no-match warning, classmap optimization requirement, and Windows-path caveat — live in `docs/adr/009-migration-manifest-discovery.md`.

**v2 ordering:** within a package, list entries traverse left-to-right. Across packages, the unified migration DAG (mission #529 / WP06) reorders nodes by their declared `dependencies()`; raw discovery order is only the input. Within an FQCN entry, classmap iteration order is implementation-defined — v2 plans should not depend on it. Use explicit `MigrationInterfaceV2::dependencies()` for cross-migration ordering.

**Entity tables:** Kernel `SqlSchemaHandler::ensureTable()` creates base columns (`id`, `uuid`, `bundle`, label/langcode keys, `_data`, …) when storage is first resolved. **Additive** columns (field-backed lookups, indexes) belong in package migrations so they run on **`db:init`** / `migrate` paths that do not eagerly touch every entity type. Do **not** add recurring `SqlSchemaHandler::addFieldColumns()` calls in `ServiceProvider::boot()` for the same DDL — that duplicates schema truth and runs every request.

**SQLite / `down()`:** Additive column migrations may use a no-op `down()` when portable `DROP COLUMN` is not guaranteed; prefer compensating migrations for breaking changes.

**Reference packages:** `waaseyaa/queue`, `waaseyaa/notification`, `waaseyaa/scheduler`, `waaseyaa/ai-observability` register `migrations`; `waaseyaa/oidc` registers its client, token, signing-key, consent, and secret-storage migrations. The secret-storage migration adds keyed lookup columns for access and refresh tokens; existing secret values are converted transactionally by the application-key-aware `oidc:migrate-secrets --confirm` command (#2037).

## HTTP Client

Minimal HTTP client with no external dependencies (uses PHP streams). Zero composer dependencies — requires only `php: >=8.4`.

### HttpClientInterface

File: `packages/http-client/src/HttpClientInterface.php`

```php
interface HttpClientInterface
{
    public function request(string $method, string $url, array $headers = [], array|string|null $body = null): HttpResponse;
    public function get(string $url, array $headers = []): HttpResponse;
    public function post(string $url, array $headers = [], array|string|null $body = null): HttpResponse;
}
```

### HttpResponse

File: `packages/http-client/src/HttpResponse.php`

```php
final readonly class HttpResponse
{
    public function __construct(
        public int $statusCode,
        public string $body,
        public array $headers = [],
    );

    public function json(): array;      // json_decode with JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR
    public function isSuccess(): bool;  // 200-299
}
```

### StreamHttpClient

File: `packages/http-client/src/StreamHttpClient.php`

Implementation using `file_get_contents()` with stream contexts. Throws `HttpRequestException` on failure. Response headers are read via `http_get_last_response_headers()` (PHP 8.5+); the legacy magic predefined `$http_response_header` was deprecated in 8.5.

### HttpRequestException

File: `packages/http-client/src/HttpRequestException.php`

```php
final class HttpRequestException extends \RuntimeException
{
    public function __construct(
        string $message,
        public readonly string $url,
        public readonly string $method,
        public readonly ?HttpResponse $response = null,
        ?\Throwable $previous = null,
    );
}
```

Carries the failed request's URL, method, and optionally the response (when the server responded but with an error status). This allows callers to inspect both transport failures and HTTP error responses uniformly.

## Logging

Waaseyaa provides its own logging interfaces (not `psr/log`). All loggers implement `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Log\LoggerInterface`.

### LoggerInterface

File: `packages/foundation/src/Log/LoggerInterface.php`

```php
interface LoggerInterface
{
    public function emergency(string|\Stringable $message, array $context = []): void;
    public function alert(string|\Stringable $message, array $context = []): void;
    public function critical(string|\Stringable $message, array $context = []): void;
    public function error(string|\Stringable $message, array $context = []): void;
    public function warning(string|\Stringable $message, array $context = []): void;
    public function notice(string|\Stringable $message, array $context = []): void;
    public function info(string|\Stringable $message, array $context = []): void;
    public function debug(string|\Stringable $message, array $context = []): void;
    public function log(LogLevel $level, string|\Stringable $message, array $context = []): void;
}
```

### LogLevel

File: `packages/foundation/src/Log/LogLevel.php`

String-backed enum: `EMERGENCY`, `ALERT`, `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`.

### LogRecord

File: `packages/foundation/src/Log/LogRecord.php`

Immutable value object carrying a single log entry: `level` (LogLevel), `message` (string), `context` (array), `channel` (string, defaults to `'default'`), `timestamp` (DateTimeImmutable, defaults to now).

### LogManager

File: `packages/foundation/src/Log/LogManager.php`

Central log orchestrator. Implements `LoggerInterface` — calling `log()` delegates to the default channel. Constructor accepts `LoggerInterface|HandlerInterface` for the default handler (legacy loggers are wrapped in `LegacyLoggerHandler`). `channel(string $name)` returns a `ChannelLogger` for the named channel; unknown channels fall back to the default. `fromConfig(array $config)` static factory builds channels from config (two-pass: non-stack handlers first, then stack handlers that reference other channels). `addGlobalProcessor(ProcessorInterface $processor)` allows runtime registration of processors (used by `HttpKernel` to add `RequestContextProcessor` after request resolution).

The kernel constructs `LogManager(new Handler\ErrorLogHandler())` at startup, then upgrades it after config loads: if `config['logging']['channels']` exists, uses `LogManager::fromConfig()`; otherwise falls back to `log_level` config with a single `Handler\ErrorLogHandler(minimumLevel: $level)`.

### ChannelLogger

File: `packages/foundation/src/Log/ChannelLogger.php`

Scoped `LoggerInterface` that stamps a channel name on every `LogRecord`, runs processors (global + per-channel), then delegates to a `HandlerInterface`. Created by `LogManager::channel()`. Constructor: `(string $channel, HandlerInterface $handler, array $processors = [])`. Processor failures are best-effort: caught, logged via `error_log()`, pipeline continues.

### Handler pipeline

| Interface/Class | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `HandlerInterface` | `Log/Handler/HandlerInterface.php` | Contract: `handle(LogRecord $record): void` |
| `ErrorLogHandler` | `Log/Handler/ErrorLogHandler.php` | Delegates to `error_log()`. Constructor: `(?FormatterInterface $formatter = null, LogLevel $minimumLevel = LogLevel::DEBUG, ?\Closure $writer = null)`. Discards messages below `minimumLevel`. |
| `FileHandler` | `Log/Handler/FileHandler.php` | Appends formatted record to a file with `LOCK_EX`. Constructor: `(string $path, ?FormatterInterface $formatter = null, LogLevel $minimumLevel = LogLevel::DEBUG)`. |
| `StackHandler` | `Log/Handler/StackHandler.php` | Fan-out to multiple handlers. Constructor: `(HandlerInterface ...$handlers)`. Best-effort: catches `\Throwable` per handler so one failure doesn't stop others. |
| `NullHandler` | `Log/Handler/NullHandler.php` | Discards all records — for testing and disabled logging. |
| `StreamHandler` | `Log/Handler/StreamHandler.php` | Writes to `php://stderr` or any stream resource. Constructor validates resource type; throws `\InvalidArgumentException` on non-resource. |
| `LegacyLoggerHandler` | `Log/LegacyLoggerHandler.php` | Adapts Phase A `LoggerInterface` implementations to `HandlerInterface`. Internal, used by `LogManager` for backward compatibility. |

### Formatter pipeline

| Interface/Class | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `FormatterInterface` | `Log/Formatter/FormatterInterface.php` | Contract: `format(LogRecord $record): string` |
| `TextFormatter` | `Log/Formatter/TextFormatter.php` | Format: `[timestamp] [level] [channel] message {context}`. Omits context braces when empty. |
| `JsonFormatter` | `Log/Formatter/JsonFormatter.php` | One JSON object per line with all fields: timestamp, level, channel, message, context. |

### Processor pipeline

Processors enrich `LogRecord` context before handlers receive the record. Execution order: global processors first, then per-channel processors.

| Interface/Class | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `ProcessorInterface` | `Log/Processor/ProcessorInterface.php` | Contract: `process(LogRecord $record): LogRecord`. Must return a new record, not mutate input. |
| `RedactorProcessor` | `Log/Processor/RedactorProcessor.php` | **Always-on security default** — prepended unconditionally by `LogManager::fromConfig()` before any config-named processors. Redacts context keys whose lowercased name contains any denylist keyword (`password`, `token`, `secret`, `authorization`, `api_key`, `cookie`) and, as a backstop, string values that contain those keywords (e.g. a verbatim `Authorization: Bearer …` header). Applies recursively to nested arrays. Replacement sentinel: `[REDACTED]`. Extra keywords accepted via constructor. Config name `redact` (can also be added explicitly via `processors` config). |
| `RequestIdProcessor` | `Log/Processor/RequestIdProcessor.php` | Adds `request_id` (UUID hex) to context. Same ID for all records within a single processor instance. |
| `HostnameProcessor` | `Log/Processor/HostnameProcessor.php` | Adds `hostname` to context. Defaults to `gethostname()`. |
| `MemoryUsageProcessor` | `Log/Processor/MemoryUsageProcessor.php` | Adds `memory_peak_mb` (float) to context. |
| `RequestContextProcessor` | `Log/Processor/RequestContextProcessor.php` | Adds `http_method`, `uri`, and optional `request_id` to context. Registered by `HttpKernel` during request handling. |

### Legacy logger implementations

| Class | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `NullLogger` | `Log/NullLogger.php` | No-op — for testing and disabled logging. Widely used across packages. |

`LoggerTrait` provides convenience methods (`emergency()`, `error()`, etc.) that delegate to `log()`.

Removed in Phase C: `FileLogger`, `CompositeLogger`, legacy `ErrorLogHandler` (at `Log/ErrorLogHandler.php`). Use `Handler\ErrorLogHandler`, `Handler\FileHandler`, `Handler\StackHandler` instead.

## Rate Limiting

### RateLimiterInterface

File: `packages/foundation/src/RateLimit/RateLimiterInterface.php`

```php
interface RateLimiterInterface
{
    /** @return array{allowed: bool, remaining: int, retryAfter: ?int} */
    public function attempt(string $key, int $maxAttempts, int $windowSeconds): array;
}
```

Single method: `attempt(key, maxAttempts, windowSeconds)` returns a result array with `allowed` (bool), `remaining` (int), and `retryAfter` (?int seconds). Consumers use this interface when they need to enforce per-key rate limits — e.g. `RateLimitMiddleware` wraps HTTP endpoints, and auth controllers use it for login attempt throttling. Inject `RateLimiterInterface`; the default binding is `InMemoryRateLimiter`.

### InMemoryRateLimiter

File: `packages/foundation/src/RateLimit/InMemoryRateLimiter.php`

Sliding-window rate limiter stored in memory. Resets per-process. Used by `RateLimitMiddleware`.

## Asset Management

### AssetManagerInterface

File: `packages/foundation/src/Asset/AssetManagerInterface.php`

```php
interface AssetManagerInterface
{
    public function url(string $path, string $bundle = 'admin'): string;
}
```

Resolves logical asset paths to hashed, cache-busted URLs. Consumers use this interface when generating `<script>` or `<link>` tags for frontend bundles — primarily SSR and the admin SPA host. Inject `AssetManagerInterface`; the default binding is `ViteAssetManager`.

### ViteAssetManager

File: `packages/foundation/src/Asset/ViteAssetManager.php`
Implements: `AssetManagerInterface`

```php
final class ViteAssetManager implements AssetManagerInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $basePath,              // dist directory path
        private readonly string $baseUrl = '/dist',
        private readonly ?string $devServerUrl = null,  // e.g., 'http://localhost:5173'
        ?LoggerInterface $logger = null,                // Waaseyaa\Foundation\Log\LoggerInterface, defaults to NullLogger
    );

    public function url(string $path, string $bundle = 'admin'): string;
    public function preloadLinks(string $bundle = 'admin'): array;
    public function assetTags(string $bundle = 'build', string $entrypoint = 'resources/js/app.ts'): string;
}
```

Reads Vite `manifest.json` files to resolve source paths to hashed asset URLs. Manifests are cached per bundle.

`assetTags()` generates HTML `<script>` and `<link>` tags for a bundle's entry assets. In production (manifest exists), it emits hashed asset tags. In dev mode (no manifest, `devServerUrl` set), it emits Vite dev server HMR tags. All attribute values are escaped via `htmlspecialchars()`. Returns empty string when neither manifest nor dev server is available.

**Fail-open manifest load observability (WP5, audit-remediation batch 2026-07-02):** `loadManifest()` fails open — a missing, unreadable, corrupt-JSON, or non-array manifest all resolve to `[]` (and are memoized as such) rather than throwing, so `url()` falls back to un-hashed paths instead of crashing the request. Every failure is logged once per bundle via the injected `LoggerInterface` (the `$manifests` memoization guarantees `loadManifest()` — and therefore the log call — runs at most once per bundle for the life of the instance). Logging rule: `missing` logs at ERROR, except when `$devServerUrl` is set, where it is downgraded to DEBUG (a missing production manifest is the expected dev-mode state — `assetTags()` falls through to `devTags()`); `unreadable`, `corrupt-json`, and `non-array` are always ERROR regardless of dev-server configuration, since those mean the manifest file exists but is broken, which is never expected. The log context carries `kind`, `bundle`, and `probed_paths` (both the `.vite/manifest.json` and legacy `manifest.json` candidates for `missing`; the single resolved path for the other three kinds). Wired at the one production composition root that constructs `ViteAssetManager` — `Waaseyaa\Inertia\InertiaServiceProvider::registerWithRoot()` — via `resolveOptional(LoggerInterface::class)` against the kernel-services bus (`ProviderRegistryKernelServices` serves `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Log\LoggerInterface` directly); absence must not crash provider registration, so the constructor default remains `NullLogger`.

### TenantAssetResolver

File: `packages/foundation/src/Asset/TenantAssetResolver.php`
Implements: `AssetManagerInterface`

Resolves tenant-specific asset paths across three tiers, first-match-wins: tenant theme (`themes/{tenant}/dist/`) → base SSR (`dist/ssr/`) → admin SPA (`dist/admin/`). `url()` walks each tier's `ViteAssetManager`, maps its candidate URL back to a filesystem path via that tier's own `basePath`/`baseUrl` pair, and returns the first URL whose backing file actually exists.

**URL namespace / filesystem root pairing (WP5, audit-remediation batch 2026-07-02):** each entry's `baseUrl` must be a distinct URL prefix that maps 1:1 to that entry's `basePath` — before this fix, the ssr and admin entries both used the bare `$baseUrl` (no suffix) while pointing at two different `basePath` roots, so the existence check for one entry could pass against a file that a real one-URL-prefix-per-root static server would never actually serve from that URL. Fixed to `<baseUrl>/ssr` ↔ `<basePath>/ssr` and `<baseUrl>/admin` ↔ `<basePath>/admin`, mirroring the tenant-theme entry's pre-existing `<baseUrl>/themes/<theme>` ↔ `<basePath>/themes/<theme>/dist` pairing. **This class is not currently wired to `AssetManagerInterface` at any composition root** — the only production binding (`InertiaServiceProvider`) constructs a bare `ViteAssetManager` directly — and no static-file-serving mechanism found in this repo (the FrankenPHP `Caddyfile`'s `root ./public` + `php_server`; the `cli-server` passthrough in `public/index.php`) supports anything other than one physical root per URL prefix. Should `TenantAssetResolver` be wired to a real static-file root in the future, that root MUST serve `<baseUrl>/ssr/**` from `<basePath>/ssr/**` and `<baseUrl>/admin/**` from `<basePath>/admin/**` for `url()`'s existence check to remain meaningful.

## Sovereignty Configuration

File: `packages/foundation/src/Sovereignty/SovereigntyConfig.php`

Provides deployment-mode defaults so applications can declare a sovereignty profile (`local`, `self_hosted`, `northops`) and get sane defaults for storage, embeddings, LLM provider, transcriber, vector store, and queue backend.

### SovereigntyProfile

File: `packages/foundation/src/Sovereignty/SovereigntyProfile.php`

```php
enum SovereigntyProfile: string
{
    case Local = 'local';
    case SelfHosted = 'self_hosted';
    case NorthOps = 'northops';
}
```

### SovereigntyDefaults

File: `packages/foundation/src/Sovereignty/SovereigntyDefaults.php`

Maps each profile to its default settings:

| Setting | `local` | `self_hosted` | `northops` |
|---|---|---|---|
| storage | filesystem | filesystem | s3 |
| embeddings | sqlite | sqlite | pgvector |
| llm_provider | ollama | ollama | api |
| transcriber | whisper_ollama | whisper_ollama | api |
| vector_store | sqlite | sqlite | pgvector |
| queue_backend | sync | database | redis |

### SovereigntyConfigInterface / SovereigntyConfig

File: `packages/foundation/src/Sovereignty/SovereigntyConfigInterface.php`

```php
interface SovereigntyConfigInterface
{
    public function get(string $key): ?string;
    public function getProfile(): SovereigntyProfile;
    /** @return array<string, string> */
    public function all(): array;
}
```

`SovereigntyConfig` resolves effective settings: profile defaults merged with per-key overrides from app config. `SovereigntyConfig::fromArray($appConfig)` reads `sovereignty_profile` from the config array (defaults to `local`) and extracts recognized override keys.

Registered as a singleton in `FoundationServiceProvider`:

```php
$this->singleton(SovereigntyConfigInterface::class, fn() => SovereigntyConfig::fromArray($this->config));
```

## Community Context

Request-scoped community isolation for multi-tenant sovereign apps. When a `CommunityContext` is active, entity storage drivers that are wired with `CommunityScope` automatically restrict all queries to the active community.

### CommunityContextInterface / CommunityContext

File: `packages/foundation/src/Community/CommunityContextInterface.php`
File: `packages/foundation/src/Community/CommunityContext.php`

```php
interface CommunityContextInterface
{
    public function set(string $communityId): void;
    public function get(): ?string;
    public function clear(): void;
    public function isActive(): bool;
}
```

`CommunityContext` is a mutable singleton registered in `FoundationServiceProvider`:

```php
$this->singleton(CommunityContextInterface::class, CommunityContext::class);
```

### CommunityMiddleware

File: `packages/foundation/src/Community/CommunityMiddleware.php`
Attribute: `#[AsMiddleware(pipeline: 'http', priority: 20)]`

Resolves the active community from the incoming request and sets it on `CommunityContextInterface` for the duration of the request. Clears the context in a `finally` block after the response.

**Resolution order (first match wins):**
1. Route parameter `community_id` (e.g. `/community/{community_id}/...`)
2. Session key `waaseyaa_community_id` (requires `SessionMiddleware` priority 30 to have run first)

When no community is resolved (CLI, admin superuser, unauthenticated), the context remains inactive and queries are unscoped.

## HTTP Utilities

### ControllerDispatcher and Domain Routers

File: `packages/foundation/src/Http/ControllerDispatcher.php`

Routes a matched controller name to the appropriate handler. Central dispatch hub for `HttpKernel`.

Handles callable controllers (objects with `__invoke(Request): Response`) directly. String controller keys are delegated to domain-specific routers in `packages/foundation/src/Http/Router/`. All controller return types are Symfony `Response` or `JsonResponse` (no custom response DTOs).

**Controller key normalization:** Routes declared with Symfony's array-callable form (`'_controller' => [FooController::class, 'bar']`) are normalized to `FooController::bar` string form before the domain router chain runs. This keeps downstream routers' `supports()` checks (which use `str_contains()` / `str_starts_with()` against `_controller`) simple — they never have to handle both shapes. `JsonApiRouter::supports()` additionally has a defensive `match()` so any misrouted array callable that slipped through produces a clean miss rather than a string-function type error.

**Inertia response handling:** When a callable controller returns a value implementing `InertiaPageResultInterface`, the dispatcher checks for the `X-Inertia` request header. XHR requests get a JSON response with the page object. Non-XHR (initial page load) requests are rendered to full HTML via the injected `InertiaFullPageRendererInterface` (bound by `InertiaServiceProvider`). If that interface is not registered, full-page Inertia requests return 500.

**RootTemplateRenderer default HTML:** `packages/inertia/src/RootTemplateRenderer.php` emits `<div id="app"></div>` and a following `<script type="application/json" data-page="app">` whose text content is the JSON page object. The `data-page` attribute value must match the root element id (default `app`) so `@inertiajs/core` `getInitialPageFromDOM()` can load the initial page on the first visit.

**Error handling:** Both the callable controller path and the router dispatch path are wrapped in try-catch. Unhandled exceptions produce a 500 JSON:API error response via `handleException()`, which includes stack trace details when debug mode is enabled.

#### DomainRouterInterface

File: `packages/foundation/src/Http/Router/DomainRouterInterface.php`

```php
interface DomainRouterInterface
{
    public function supports(Request $request): bool;
    public function handle(Request $request): Response;
}
```

Deterministic chain: `HttpKernel` iterates routers in order; first `supports()` match wins.

**Merge order:** Built-in foundation routers (in `HttpKernel::serveHttpRequest`) run as: `JsonApiRouter`, `EntityTypeLifecycleRouter`, `SchemaRouter`, `SearchRouter`, then each discovered `ServiceProvider::httpDomainRouters(?HttpKernel)` in **package manifest order**, then **`BroadcastRouter`** last.

**Kernel hooks:** After access policies are registered and before `$kernel->booted` is set, `HttpKernel::finalizeBoot()` prepares shared cache backends, discovery handler, MCP/render cache listeners from `EventListenerRegistrar`, per-provider `registerRenderCacheListeners()` and `configureHttpKernel()` (SSR builds `SsrPageHandler` there so `EntityAccessGate` sees a fully wired `EntityAccessHandler`).

#### WaaseyaaContext

File: `packages/foundation/src/Http/Router/WaaseyaaContext.php`

Typed value object built once from the request via `WaaseyaaContext::fromRequest()`. Provides `account`, `parsedBody`, `query`, `method`, and `broadcastStorage` to routers.

#### SSR app controllers: inbound HTTP boundary

`SsrPageHandler::dispatchAppController()` invokes app methods as `($params, $query, $account, $httpRequest)` where `$httpRequest` is Symfony’s `Request`. That fourth argument stays the dispatcher contract.

Return values: **`HttpResponse`** is returned as-is (with render `Cache-Control` applied). **`InertiaPageResultInterface`** is converted like `ControllerDispatcher`: when `X-Inertia: true`, respond with JSON:API content type and Inertia headers; otherwise render full HTML via `InertiaFullPageRendererInterface` from `HttpKernel::getInertiaFullPageRenderer()` (wired from `SsrServiceProvider::configureHttpKernel()`). If Inertia is returned but no full-page renderer is registered, dispatch yields a 500 JSON:API error. Any other return type still produces the legacy 500 HTML snippet.

Below the controller entrypoint, **do not** pass `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request` into application or domain services. Build **`InboundHttpRequest::fromSymfonyRequest($httpRequest, $params, $query)`** once per action and pass **`InboundHttpRequestInterface`** (or the concrete snapshot for construction only) downward.

`InboundHttpRequest` is an immutable snapshot: route and query bags are the arrays the router already extracted (not re-read from the request); the body merges `$request->request->all()` with the `_parsed_body` attribute when it is an array (JSON keys overlay form keys). Headers and cookies are copied at construction time.

Optional follow-ups (full header map API, lazy adapter, JSON:API adoption) are tracked as [#1174](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/1174), [#1175](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/1175), and [#1176](https://github.com/waaseyaa/framework/issues/1176) and do not block this convention.

#### Domain Routers

| Router | Controller key(s) | Purpose |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| `JsonApiRouter` | `jsonapi.*` | JSON:API CRUD delegation to `JsonApiController`. `handle()` now threads `$ctx->query` into single-resource `show()` calls too (CW-v1 option-1, #1920 PR-3 — previously only the collection `index()` call received it), needed for the new `?workingCopy=1` toggle (`docs/specs/api-layer.md` "GET single") and, as a side effect, fixing a pre-existing gap where sparse fieldsets (`fields[type]`) never reached a single-resource GET over HTTP. |
| `EntityTypeLifecycleRouter` | `entity_types`, `entity_type.disable`, `entity_type.enable` | Entity type listing and lifecycle management |
| `SchemaRouter` | `openapi`, `schema.*` | OpenAPI and JSON Schema endpoints |
| `DiscoveryRouter` (`Waaseyaa\Api\Http\Router`) | `discovery.topic_hub`, `discovery.cluster`, `discovery.timeline`, `discovery.endpoint` | Discovery API for topic hubs, clusters, timelines (registered from `ApiServiceProvider::httpDomainRouters()`) |
| `SearchRouter` | `search.semantic` | Semantic search via embedding storage |
| `MediaRouter` (`Waaseyaa\Media\Http\Router`) | `media.upload` | Authenticated `GET /api/media/upload` exposes only safe size/MIME constraints; authenticated `POST` retains the existing multipart upload with `access media` plus bundle-specific create access enforced before persistence. File validation includes size limits, sanitization, and move error handling (`MediaServiceProvider`). MIME validation is **sniff-only and fail-closed** (2026-07-01 WP4 hardening): the type is detected from file contents via `UploadHandler::detectMimeType()` (ext-fileinfo) — the client-declared MIME is never consulted (Symfony `getMimeType()` is not called; symfony/mime is not installed), and undetectable types are rejected 415 (`File type could not be verified.`). Allowlist matching is shared with `UploadHandler` (`mimeTypeMatches()`, exact + `type/*` wildcards). Default allowlist deliberately EXCLUDES `image/svg+xml` (script-capable; `/files/` serving adds no attachment/nosniff headers) and `application/octet-stream` (finfo's answer for any unrecognized binary); sites opt back in explicitly via `upload_allowed_mime_types`. The stored `File.mimeType` is the sniffed type. |

#### BuiltinRouteRegistrar (named routes)

File: `packages/foundation/src/Kernel/BuiltinRouteRegistrar.php`

This kernel-adjacent registrar runs once at boot (called from `HttpKernel`) and writes the framework-substrate named routes onto the `WaaseyaaRouter`, then calls every service provider's `routes()` method so app-owned routes claim explicit paths before the SSR catch-alls. `sortRoutesByPriority()` is called once at the end so `priority()` overrides settle deterministically.

**WP5 route-table inversion (foundation wave-2):** The 14 `Waaseyaa\Api\*` route groups previously hard-coded here were moved to `ApiServiceProvider::routes()`. `BuiltinRouteRegistrar` now registers only the framework-substrate routes it legitimately owns — routes that must exist regardless of which higher-layer packages are installed (broadcast SSE, OpenAPI, media upload, attachment download, semantic search, discovery, entity-type admin, SSR catch-alls). This eliminates a hidden L0→L4 string-literal dependency that PL005 could not see (the file is Kernel/-exempt from `use`-import scanning). The new **PL008** gate in `bin/check-package-layers` now guards against this pattern for all L0 `src/` files.

**Routes currently registered by `BuiltinRouteRegistrar` (framework-substrate only):**

| Group | Paths | Access gate |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| OpenAPI schema doc | `GET /api/openapi.json` | `_authenticated` |
| Entity-type catalog + lifecycle | `GET /api/entity-types`; `POST /api/entity-types/{entity_type}/{enable,disable}` | `_role: admin` |
| Broadcast (SSE) | `GET /api/broadcast` | default |
| Media upload/download | `POST /api/media/upload`; `GET /media/{id}/download` | `access media`; `allowAll` transport posture + download handler entity-view enforcement |
| Attachment download | `GET /attachment/{id}/download` | option-less (handler enforces) |
| Semantic search | `GET /api/search` | default |
| Discovery endpoints | `GET /api/discovery/{hub,cluster,timeline,endpoint}/…` | default |
| Provider loop | _(delegates to each `ServiceProvider::routes()`)_ | per provider |
| SSR catch-all | `GET /`, `GET /{path}` with negative-lookahead on `/api` | `allowAll` (render) |

**Routes now registered by `ApiServiceProvider::routes()` (via the provider loop above):**

| Group | Paths | Access gate |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Schema self-description | `GET /api/schema/{entity_type}` | `_authenticated` |
| Workflow admin | `GET /api/workflow-definitions` | `_role: admin` |
| Queue admin | `GET /api/queue/jobs`; `POST /api/queue/jobs/{id}/{retry,discard}` | `_role: admin` |
| Scheduler admin | `GET /api/scheduler/tasks`; `POST /api/scheduler/tasks/{name}/trigger` | `_role: admin` |
| Notification admin | `GET /api/notification/channels`; `POST /api/notification/channels/{type}/test` | `_role: admin` |
| Mercure monitor | `GET /api/mercure/{channels,events,subscribers}` | `_role: admin` |
| Media versions | `GET /api/media/{uuid}/versions[/{vid}]` | `_authenticated` |
| OCAP audit log | `GET /api/audit/events` | `_role: admin` |
| MCP-admin REST | `GET /api/mcp/tools`; `GET /api/mcp/tools/{name}`; `GET /api/mcp/server-config` | `_role: admin` |
| OIDC client CRUD | `GET\|POST\|PATCH\|DELETE /api/oidc-clients[/{id}[/regenerate-secret]]` | `_role: admin` |
| Classification retention policies | `GET\|POST\|PATCH\|DELETE /api/classification/policies[/{id}]` | mixed |
| JSON:API CRUD (all entity types) | `GET\|POST\|PATCH\|DELETE /api/{entity_type}[/{id}]` | per entity access policy |

Dispatch contracts for each named route live in the API package (`packages/api/src/Http/Router/*` — e.g. `McpAdminApiRouter`, `QueueAdminApiRouter`). See `docs/specs/api-layer.md` for per-router DTOs and response shapes.

**Layer-discipline rationale.** Foundation is L0. `BuiltinRouteRegistrar` lives under `<pkg>/src/Kernel/` and falls under the implicit Kernel exemption tier of `bin/check-package-layers` for PL005 (`use`-import scanning) and PL008 (string-literal scanning). The few string FQCNs that remain after WP5 (`'Waaseyaa\\Foundation\\Http\\Router\\BroadcastRouter'` etc.) all reference L0 classes — no higher-layer FQCNs remain in the registrar. App-layer routes now flow through providers via the `routes()` hook, which is the intended architecture for provider-owned surfaces.

### CorsHandler

File: `packages/foundation/src/Http/CorsHandler.php`

```php
final class CorsHandler
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly array $allowedOrigins = ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'],
        private readonly bool $allowDevLocalhostPorts = false,
        ?LoggerInterface $logger = null,
    );

    public function resolveCorsHeaders(string $origin): array;
    public function handlePreflight(string $origin, string $requestMethod): array;
    public function isCorsPreflightRequest(string $method): bool;
}
```

CORS origin resolution in `HttpKernel::handleCors()`:
1. Reads `cors_origins` from config (defaults to `localhost:3000` and `127.0.0.1:3000`).
2. Checks `WAASEYAA_CORS_ORIGIN` env var — if set, overrides the config array with a single-origin list.
3. Passes `allowDevLocalhostPorts: true` when the kernel is in development mode (env is `dev`, `development`, `local`, or `testing`), allowing any localhost port.

### HTTP middleware and dispatch pipeline (`HttpKernel::serveHttpRequest`)

`serveHttpRequest()` orchestrates three focused private steps: `matchRoute()` (builds the `WaaseyaaRouter`, matches the path, populates `HttpRequest` attributes — returns `HttpResponse` on 404/405/500), `buildMiddlewareStack()` (assembles and sorts the HTTP pipeline, returns `HttpPipeline`), and `buildRouterChain()` (assembles domain routers + `BroadcastRouter`, returns `ControllerDispatcher`).

After routing matches, `HttpKernel` builds an `HttpPipeline` of HTTP middleware (security headers, Bearer auth, session, CSRF, `AuthorizationMiddleware`, provider middleware). Its terminal handler performs request-body preparation and real controller/domain-router dispatch.

If any middleware short-circuits — for example `AuthorizationMiddleware` returning **302** to `/login` for unauthenticated `_authenticated` render routes, or **401** JSON:API for API routes — it does not call the terminal handler and its response is returned through the outer response-side middleware. Otherwise every middleware unwinds over the real dispatched response, including non-200 controller responses.

Exceptions thrown by terminal dispatch setup (including provider router construction) bubble through the pipeline to the outer `HttpKernel::handle()` catch, preserving the established unhandled-exception JSON detail and log classification. The narrower local pipeline catch remains responsible only for exceptions originating in middleware.

### Response-side middleware contract

`CsrfMiddleware` attaches `XSRF-TOKEN` while unwinding over a final `text/html` response. `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` applies framing and MIME-sniffing defaults in the same response phase. Provider middleware contributed through `HasMiddlewareInterface` gets the identical supported hook: code after `$next->handle($request)` receives the final response and may return a replacement or decorated response.

Behaviour of the CSRF response step:

- **Restricted to `text/html`** — skips JSON, octet-stream, and any other primary Content-Type.
- **Idempotent** — no-ops if an `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie is already present on the response (the middleware may have set it for non-validating GET requests that pass through without the 200-stub issue).
- **Session guard** — returns immediately if no PHP session is active or the session token key is absent.

The kernel does not duplicate these mutations after dispatch; the middleware onion is the response phase.

### SlugGenerator (Unicode-preserving slugs)

File: `packages/foundation/src/SlugGenerator.php` — `SlugGenerator::generate(string $value): string`.

**Policy: preserve Unicode, never transliterate to ASCII.** Waaseyaa is an Indigenous-language CMS; ASCII transliteration destroys meaning in Anishinaabemowin orthography (long-vowel diacritics `ā`/`í`, the glottal `ʼ` U+02BC — a *letter*, category Lm — and Canadian syllabics). Pipeline:

1. `trim()`, then NFC-normalize (`\Normalizer::FORM_C`) so decomposed input (base letter + combining mark) slugs identically to its precomposed form.
2. `mb_strtolower(..., 'UTF-8')`, then NFC-normalize **again** — lowercasing can itself emit combining marks (`İ` U+0130 → `i` + U+0307).
3. Replace runs of `[^\p{L}\p{N}\p{M}]+` with `-` (`/u` flag), then trim leading/trailing hyphens. `\p{M}` is in the keep-class so combining marks with **no precomposed form** (the S̱aanich macron-below U+0331, the Tłı̨chǫ ogonek on dotless `ı`) survive attached to their base letter instead of splitting the word.
4. Invalid UTF-8 degrades to the historical byte-wise ASCII slugging (`strtolower` + `[^a-z0-9]+`) instead of erroring; empty input still yields `''` (callers own the empty-slug fallback).

Pure-ASCII inputs produce byte-identical slugs to the pre-Unicode implementation (regression-pinned in `SlugGeneratorTest`). Unicode slugs are percent-encoded on the wire and decoded by Symfony's `UrlMatcher` (`rawurldecode`) before matching; `WaaseyaaRouter::generate()` percent-encodes them on the way out — round-trip pinned in `WaaseyaaRouterTest`. Consumers: Minoo ingestion mappers (see `docs/specs/extraction-log.md` #692); no in-monorepo callers. `symfony/polyfill-mbstring` and `symfony/polyfill-intl-normalizer` are explicit foundation requires so standalone installs get `mb_strtolower`/`\Normalizer` without the extensions.

### Dev fallback account

`HttpKernel::shouldUseDevFallbackAccount()` controls whether `DevAdminAccount` is injected as the session fallback. All three conditions must be true:
- PHP SAPI is `cli-server` (built-in dev server)
- Application is in development mode (`config.environment` or `APP_ENV` is dev/development/local/testing)
- `config.auth.dev_fallback_account` is explicitly `true`

## Operator Diagnostics

### DiagnosticCode

File: `packages/foundation/src/Diagnostic/DiagnosticCode.php`

String-backed enum of operator-facing error codes:

| Code | Trigger |
|------|---------|
| `DEFAULT_TYPE_MISSING` | No entity types registered at boot |
| `DEFAULT_TYPE_DISABLED` | All registered types disabled |
| `DATABASE_UNREACHABLE` | Database file missing or corrupt |
| `DATABASE_SCHEMA_DRIFT` | Entity table columns don't match expected schema (base or bundle subtable) |
| `MISSING_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` | A bundle with registered fields has no `{base}__{bundle}` subtable |
| `ORPHAN_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` | A `{base}__{bundle}` subtable exists with no registered bundle fields |
| `FK_ENFORCEMENT_DISABLED` | Foreign-key enforcement off at the connection level (e.g. SQLite without `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`) |
| `STORAGE_DIRECTORY_MISSING` | `storage/framework/` does not exist |
| `CACHE_DIRECTORY_UNWRITABLE` | Cache directory not writable |
| `INGESTION_LOG_OVERSIZED` | Ingestion log exceeds retention threshold |
| `INGESTION_RECENT_FAILURES` | High ingestion failure rate |
| `COLUMN_DATA_STORAGE_DRIFT` | A field registered with `FieldStorage::Data` still has a backing column on the base table or a bundle subtable (new writes go to `_data`; the column holds stale values) |

Each code has a `defaultMessage()` method for human-readable descriptions. Severity: `MISSING_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` and `FK_ENFORCEMENT_DISABLED` are errors; `ORPHAN_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` and `COLUMN_DATA_STORAGE_DRIFT` are warnings (the base row is still reachable, the lingering surface is merely stale).

### DiagnosticEmitter

File: `packages/foundation/src/Diagnostic/DiagnosticEmitter.php`

```php
final class DiagnosticEmitter
{
    public function __construct(?LoggerInterface $logger = null);
    public function emit(DiagnosticCode $code, string $message, array $context = []): DiagnosticEntry;
}
```

Emits structured JSON diagnostic log entries. Returns `DiagnosticEntry` for callers that need to inspect or re-throw.

### HealthCheckerInterface

File: `packages/foundation/src/Diagnostic/HealthCheckerInterface.php`

Contract for running operator health checks. Consumers use this interface when they need to programmatically query system health — e.g. the `health:check` CLI command and any monitoring integration. Inject `HealthCheckerInterface`; the default binding is `HealthChecker`. Results are `HealthCheckResult` value objects with pass/warn/fail status.

### HealthChecker

File: `packages/foundation/src/Diagnostic/HealthChecker.php`
Implements: `HealthCheckerInterface`

```php
final class HealthChecker implements HealthCheckerInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly BootDiagnosticReport $bootReport,
        private readonly DatabaseInterface $database,
        private readonly EntityTypeManagerInterface $entityTypeManager,
        private readonly string $projectRoot,
        ?LoggerInterface $logger = null,
        ?FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface $fieldRegistry = null,
    );

    public function runAll(): array;          // list<HealthCheckResult>
    public function checkBoot(): array;       // entity type registry state
    public function checkRuntime(): array;    // database, schema drift, storage, cache dirs, FK enforcement
    public function checkSchemaDrift(): array; // base + bundle subtable drift
    public function checkIngestion(): array;  // ingestion log health, error rates
}
```

Three check groups: boot (entity type registry), runtime (database connectivity, schema drift, storage directories, foreign-key enforcement), and ingestion (log size, error rate). Results are `HealthCheckResult` value objects with pass/warn/fail status.

#### Subtable-aware schema drift

For any entity type whose `EntityType::getBundleEntityType()` is non-null, `checkSchemaDrift()` does not stop at the base table. It enumerates the registered bundles via `$this->fieldRegistry->bundleNamesFor($entityTypeId)`, and for each bundle:

- If the bundle has registered fields (`bundleFieldsFor()` is non-empty) but the `{base}__{bundle}` subtable is absent, emits `MISSING_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` (fail).
- If a `{base}__{bundle}` subtable exists but no fields are registered for that bundle, emits `ORPHAN_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` (warn). Orphan detection scans `sqlite_master LIKE '{base_table}__%'` (ESCAPE-aware) and compares against the registry.
- If the subtable exists but its columns do not match the registered field shape, the existing `DATABASE_SCHEMA_DRIFT` code is emitted with the subtable name in the message so the operator can distinguish base-table drift from bundle-table drift.

The `fieldRegistry` parameter is optional to preserve the prior constructor contract for callers that predate per-bundle storage; when null, `HealthChecker` degrades to base-table-only drift detection (its former behaviour).

#### FK enforcement health check

`checkRuntime()` probes `PRAGMA foreign_keys` on SQLite connections. If the pragma reports `0`, it emits `FK_ENFORCEMENT_DISABLED` (fail), since `ON DELETE CASCADE` from the base table to bundle subtables silently becomes a no-op. MySQL/InnoDB is on by default but can be disabled per-session; any new driver added to `DBALDatabase` must be audited for FK-default behaviour.

#### Wiring

Both `AbstractKernel` and `ConsoleKernel` expose the `FieldDefinitionRegistry` they construct during `bootEntityTypeManager()` via a protected `$fieldRegistry` property, and pass it through when instantiating `HealthChecker` for CLI health commands. The same registry instance is shared with `SqlSchemaHandler`, `SqlEntityStorage`, and `ContentEntityBase::setFieldRegistry()`, so drift detection sees exactly the bundle set the storage layer is materializing.

Authoritative contracts: `docs/specs/bundle-scoped-storage.md §Drift diagnostic` and `docs/specs/operator-diagnostics.md` define the codes and their operator-facing semantics; this section describes how `HealthChecker` surfaces them.

### Role registry composition

`AbstractKernel::buildHandlerContainer()` composes the CLI handler container from the booted provider list and returns a `KernelHandlerContainer` instance (`packages/foundation/src/Kernel/KernelHandlerContainer.php`), a named PSR-11 `ContainerInterface` implementation that replaced the inline anonymous class. Among its kernel-owned bindings it registers `Waaseyaa\User\RoleRepository` via `RoleRepository::fromProviders($this->providers)`, which scans every provider implementing `Waaseyaa\Foundation\ServiceProvider\Capability\ProvidesRolesInterface` and flattens their `Role` contributions into an id-keyed registry. This is a kernel-owned service mirroring the `HealthChecker` composition pattern above: a type no single provider binds, assembled once by the kernel and made injectable into class-based command handlers. It lets role-aware handlers such as the `user:assign-role` handler (`Waaseyaa\CLI\Handler\UserAssignRoleHandler`) resolve a role to its registered permissions and stamp the union onto a user. See `docs/specs/access-control.md §Roles` for the role-to-permission model.

## Internal Interfaces

These foundation interfaces are `@internal` and not part of the public consumer API. They are listed here for completeness and to prevent accidental exposure.

### TenantResolverInterface

File: `packages/foundation/src/Tenant/TenantResolverInterface.php`

`@internal` — tenant resolution is not yet a consumer-facing contract. The interface exists for framework use only and may change without notice. Do not inject or implement this interface in application code.

### Mail interfaces

Files: `packages/mail/src/MailerInterface.php`, `packages/mail/src/Transport/TransportInterface.php`

`@internal` — foundation seam. **`AuthMailer`**, **`MailChannel`** (notifications), and app commands send mail via **`MailerInterface::send(Envelope)`**. **`MailServiceProvider`** binds `TransportInterface`: when `mail.sendgrid_api_key` and `mail.from_address` are both non-empty after trim, **`SendGridTransport`** is used; otherwise `mail.transport` selects **`ArrayTransport`** or **`LocalTransport`**. Application code should not depend on these interfaces directly where a higher-level API exists — use **`AuthMailer`**, notification channels, or the shared mailer binding.

**`Envelope` input invariant (mail M1):** `Envelope::__construct()` rejects CR (`\r`), LF (`\n`), and NUL (`\0`) in `from`, `subject`, each `to` address, and each custom header name/value — throwing `\InvalidArgumentException` — to prevent email header injection and log injection. `textBody`/`htmlBody` are exempt (body content legitimately contains newlines). Defence lives at the data boundary so all transports benefit.

## Queue System

File: `packages/queue/`
Namespace: `Waaseyaa\Queue\`

### QueueInterface

File: `packages/queue/src/QueueInterface.php`

Queue implementations: `DbalQueue` (DBAL-backed persistent), `InMemoryQueue` (testing), `MessageBusQueue` (Symfony Messenger bridge), `SyncQueue` (immediate execution).

### Worker

File: `packages/queue/src/Worker/Worker.php`
Class: `final class Worker`

Constructor: `(TransportInterface $transport, FailedJobRepositoryInterface $failedJobRepository, array $handlers, ?LoggerInterface $logger = null)`

Long-running daemon that processes jobs from a queue transport.

**Public API:**
- `run(string $queue, WorkerOptions $options): int` — daemon loop, returns count of jobs processed
- `runNextJob(string $queue, WorkerOptions $options): bool` — process single job (non-looping, useful for tests)
- `stop(): void` — request graceful shutdown (finishes current job, then exits)
- `addHandler(HandlerInterface $handler): void` — prepend a handler (first added = highest priority)

**Stop conditions** (checked in `shouldContinue()`):
- `$shouldQuit` flag set (via `stop()` or POSIX signal)
- `maxJobs` reached (`$options->maxJobs > 0 && $processed >= $options->maxJobs`)
- `maxTime` elapsed (`$options->maxTime > 0 && (time() - $startTime) >= $options->maxTime`)
- Memory growth budget exhausted (`$options->memoryLimit > 0` and `(memory_get_usage(true) - baselineBytes) >= $options->memoryLimit * 1024 * 1024`, where `baselineBytes` is captured once at the start of `run()` — **not** total process RSS; avoids exiting immediately when the host process is already large)

**POSIX signal handling:** `listenForSignals()` registers SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers that set `$shouldQuit = true`. `pcntl_signal_dispatch()` is called each iteration in `shouldContinue()`. Gracefully degrades when `pcntl` extension is unavailable.

**Job processing pipeline:**
1. `transport->pop($queue)` — dequeue raw message (`{id, payload, attempts}`)
2. `@unserialize($raw['payload'])` — deserialize (failures recorded to `FailedJobRepository`)
3. **Crash-recovery safety net (queue M1):** if `$raw['attempts'] >= maxTries` (`Job::$tries` or `WorkerOptions::$maxTries`; `0` = unlimited), the job has exhausted its budget — e.g. it was repeatedly claimed then abandoned by crashed workers, each transport reclaim bumping `attempts` — so it is recorded failed (+ `Job::failed()` best-effort) and rejected **instead of being run again**. This is what stops an always-crashing job from being reclaimed forever.
4. First matching `HandlerInterface::supports($message)` handles the job
5. If `Job::isReleased()`, release back to queue with delay; otherwise `transport->ack()`
6. On exception: retry with exponential backoff (`min(baseDelay * 2^(attempts-1), 3600)`) if under `maxTries`, otherwise record failure and call `Job::failed($e)` (best-effort). If that failure hook throws, log `queue.failure_hook_failed` with both exceptions and keep the worker alive.

`SyncQueue` has no worker boundary: handler exceptions propagate to its caller
and it does not create failed-job rows. The caller owns rollback, logging, and
retry policy for inline dispatch.

**WorkerOptions** (`packages/queue/src/Worker/WorkerOptions.php`): Controls `maxJobs`, `maxTime`, `memoryLimit` (MiB of heap growth allowed during each `run()` call), `sleep` (seconds between polls), `maxTries`.

### Transport layer

`TransportInterface` (`packages/queue/src/Transport/TransportInterface.php`) abstracts job serialization/deserialization. Implementations: `DbalTransport` (database-backed), `InMemoryTransport` (testing).

**Lease / visibility timeout (`DbalTransport`, crash recovery — queue M1).** A claim stamps `reserved_at = now`; the claim is a **lease** that expires after `visibilityTimeout` seconds (constructor arg, default `90`, configurable via `queue.visibility_timeout`). Without this, a worker that dies (SIGKILL / OOM / reboot) between claiming and ack/release strands its row in `reserved` state forever — never retried, never failed (a silent data-loss bug). `pop()` therefore selects rows that are **either** unreserved **or** past their lease deadline (`COALESCE(reserved_at, 0) <= now - visibilityTimeout`, which folds both cases into one race-safe condition since `now - visibilityTimeout` is always a positive unix timestamp). The claim stays atomic: a **fresh** claim updates `reserved_at` guarded by `reserved_at IS NULL`; a **reclaim** updates `reserved_at` **and bumps `attempts`** guarded by the exact prior `reserved_at` value, so a concurrent reclaimer loses the race (0 rows → retry). Bumping `attempts` on reclaim is what feeds the worker's max-attempts / failed-job path (pipeline step 3) so an always-crashing job terminates instead of looping. The fix re-uses the existing `reserved_at` column — **no schema change / migration**. (`InMemoryTransport` is single-process and dies with its queue, so it does not reclaim.)

### Failed job tracking

`FailedJobRepositoryInterface` with implementations: `DatabaseFailedJobRepository` (DBAL-backed), `InMemoryFailedJobRepository` (testing).

Failed-job re-dispatch is claimed before delivery through `claimForRetry()`. The database implementation performs a conditional update equivalent to `UPDATE waaseyaa_failed_jobs SET retried_at = ? WHERE id = ? AND retried_at IS NULL`; exactly one concurrent API/CLI caller can win. A dispatch exception releases that marker, while successful dispatch forgets the row. The existing nullable `retried_at` column supplies the atomic seam, so no schema change is required.

The legacy concrete `FailedJobRepository` class (a thin facade delegating to `InMemoryFailedJobRepository`) is **deprecated**. Its constructor carries a PHP 8.4 `#[\Deprecated(message: …, since: '0.1')]` attribute so that any `new FailedJobRepository(...)` call emits `E_USER_DEPRECATED` and surfaces in PHPStan/IDEs/Reflection. The class-level `@deprecated` docblock is retained because PHP 8.4's `\Deprecated` attribute disallows class targets (`Attribute::TARGET_FUNCTION | TARGET_METHOD | TARGET_CLASS_CONSTANT` only), so docblock and constructor-attribute together provide full coverage. New code MUST type-hint `FailedJobRepositoryInterface` and inject `InMemoryFailedJobRepository` or `DatabaseFailedJobRepository` directly.

### Message types

| Message | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `EntityMessage` | Entity lifecycle events for async processing |
| `ConfigMessage` | Config change propagation |
| `GenericMessage` | Arbitrary payload |

### Job attributes

| Attribute | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `#[OnQueue('name')]` | Route job to a specific queue |
| `#[RateLimited]` | Apply in-process rate limiting to job dispatch — **SyncQueue-only; NOT enforced by DbalQueue** |
| `#[UniqueJob]` | Prevent duplicate dispatch within a single process — **SyncQueue-only; NOT enforced by DbalQueue** |

**`#[UniqueJob]` / `#[RateLimited]` scope limitation (queue M2).** Both attributes are evaluated by `AttributeGuard`, which performs pure in-memory, per-PHP-process tracking. They are enforced correctly by `SyncQueue` (same-process execution). `DbalQueue` (the persistent transport-backed driver) does NOT call `AttributeGuard` — cross-process enforcement would require a distributed dedup/rate-limit store and is currently unimplemented. To prevent silent consumer confusion, `DbalQueue` logs a `warning` (once per job class per process via a dedup set) when dispatching a message that carries one of these attributes. The job is still pushed to the transport.

### Job composition

`BatchedJobs` groups multiple jobs for parallel execution. `ChainedJobs` runs jobs sequentially — failure stops the chain.

### Migration

`CreateQueueTables` (`packages/queue/src/Migration/CreateQueueTables.php`) and timestamped migrations under `packages/queue/migrations/` (registered via `extra.waaseyaa.migrations` in `packages/queue/composer.json`) create **`waaseyaa_queue_jobs`** and **`waaseyaa_failed_jobs`**. Older docs may refer to unprefixed names; the DDL above is authoritative.

## Kernel Bootstrap

The kernel boot sequence is decomposed into extracted bootstrapper classes in `packages/foundation/src/Kernel/Bootstrap/`. `AbstractKernel` delegates to these rather than inlining the logic.

### AbstractKernel

File: `packages/foundation/src/Kernel/AbstractKernel.php`

Constructor: `(string $projectRoot, ?LoggerInterface $logger = null)`

Default logger is `LogManager(new Handler\ErrorLogHandler())`. After config loads, the kernel rebuilds it: if `config['logging']['channels']` exists, uses `LogManager::fromConfig()`; otherwise uses `Handler\ErrorLogHandler(minimumLevel: $level)` from `config['log_level']`.

Boot sequence (idempotent — guarded by `$this->booted` flag, set only after all steps succeed):

```
EnvLoader::load(.env)
  → ConfigLoader::load(config/waaseyaa.php)
  → rebuild LogManager (fromConfig if logging.channels exists, else log_level fallback)
  → debug/environment safety guard
  → resolve WAASEYAA_APP_SECRET into kernel-owned ApplicationSecret (before database IO)
  → new EventDispatcher()
  → new EntityTypeLifecycleManager($projectRoot)
  → new EntityAuditLogger($projectRoot)
  → register EntityWriteAuditListener on PRE_SAVE, POST_SAVE, POST_DELETE
  → bootDatabase()           // DatabaseBootstrapper
  → bootEntityTypeManager()  // delegates to EntityTypeManagerFactory: repository factory (EntityRepository, sole engine post-C-22) — no storage factory is wired
  → compileManifest()        // ManifestBootstrapper
  → bootMigrations()         // reuses DBAL connection from bootDatabase
  → discoverAndRegisterProviders()  // ProviderRegistry
  → loadAppEntityTypes()     // reads config/entity-types.php
  → validateContentTypes()   // DiagnosticEmitter check
  → bootProviders()          // calls boot() on all registered providers
  → discoverAccessPolicies() // AccessPolicyRegistry
  → bootKnowledgeExtensionRunner() // plugin discovery for knowledge tooling extensions
  → $this->booted = true
```

Early boot initializes the entity lifecycle manager (for disabling entity types at runtime) and the entity audit logger (for write audit trails). The `EntityWriteAuditListener` is registered on the event dispatcher before any entity storage is created, ensuring all entity writes are audited from boot onward.

`bootEntityTypeManager()` wires storage for each registered entity type. The construction logic is delegated to `EntityTypeManagerFactory` (`packages/foundation/src/Kernel/EntityTypeManagerFactory.php`); the kernel threads in callables for the lazy access-handler resolver, the community-scope resolver, and the account-context attacher — keeping the factory dependency-free while preserving the lazy resolution semantics. Every `SqlSchemaHandler` instantiated in that path receives the kernel's `LoggerInterface` as its fifth constructor argument (after entity type, database, shared `FieldDefinitionRegistry`, and optional `null` bundle enumerator) so schema derivation can log unknown field types without failing boot. Column mapping contract: [`field/column-derivation.md`](./field/column-derivation.md).

`loadAppEntityTypes()` reads `config/entity-types.php` and registers any `EntityTypeInterface` instances found there. Non-conforming entries are logged as warnings. Registration failures (duplicate IDs, invalid definitions) are logged as errors but do not halt boot.

`validateContentTypes()` checks that at least one entity type is registered and enabled. If no types exist, it emits `DEFAULT_TYPE_MISSING` and throws. If all registered types are disabled via the lifecycle manager, it emits `DEFAULT_TYPE_DISABLED` and throws.

`bootKnowledgeExtensionRunner()` reads `config.extensions.plugin_directories` and `config.extensions.plugin_attribute`, discovers plugins via `AttributeDiscovery`, and builds a `KnowledgeToolingExtensionRunner`. On failure, falls back to an empty runner. The runner is accessible via `getKnowledgeToolingExtensionRunner()` and provides `applyWorkflowContext()`, `applyTraversalContext()`, and `applyDiscoveryContext()` extension hooks.

#### Environment and debug introspection

Three protected methods provide environment awareness to all kernel subclasses:

| Method | Resolution | Returns |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `resolveEnvironment(): string` | Config `'environment'` key → `APP_ENV` env var → `'production'` | Canonical environment name (e.g., `'production'`, `'local'`, `'development'`) |
| `isDevelopmentMode(): bool` | Calls `resolveEnvironment()`, checks if value is `dev`, `development`, `local`, or `testing` (case-insensitive) | `true` in dev environments |
| `isDebugMode(): bool` | `APP_DEBUG` env var → config `'debug'` key → `false` | `true` when debug is enabled |

**Boot guard:** Immediately after loading configuration, `boot()` checks `isDebugMode() && !isDevelopmentMode()`. If debug is enabled outside a development environment, it throws `RuntimeException` with the message `APP_DEBUG must not be enabled in production (APP_ENV=...)`. This prevents accidentally deploying with debug mode active.

#### Layer 0 environment variable contract

These variables and config keys are the primary **bootstrap surface** for operators and Layer 0 code. Prefer reading configuration from `ConfigLoader` output after `EnvLoader::load()`; direct `getenv` / `$_ENV` / `$_SERVER` reads in foundation-adjacent packages should stay limited to the seams below or be documented here when extended.

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| `APP_ENV` | Canonical environment name; falls back to config `environment`, then `'production'`. Drives `isDevelopmentMode()` and the production SQLite existence guard. |
| `APP_DEBUG` | Boolean debug flag; falls back to config `debug`. **Must not be true** when the resolved environment is non-development (see boot guard above). |
| `WAASEYAA_APP_SECRET` | Sole application master secret. Outside `local`/`dev`/`development`/`testing`, it must be `base64:` plus canonical RFC 4648 encoding of exactly 32 bytes and is resolved before database boot. Development kernels synthesize a per-kernel ephemeral value when absent. `ApplicationSecret` derives raw 32-byte HKDF-SHA-256 keys with public salt `waaseyaa.app-secret.hkdf.v1` and distinct versioned purpose labels; master and derived bytes are never configuration values, logs, exceptions, or serialized payloads. |
| `WAASEYAA_DB` | Optional override for the SQLite database file path when `config['database']` is not set (see `DatabaseBootstrapper`). Relative values resolve against the kernel **project root**, never the process CWD (#1650 / FR-007); absolute values (POSIX, Windows drive-letter, UNC) and `:memory:` pass through untouched. |
| `WAASEYAA_CONFIG_DIR` | Optional override for the sync config directory (used by `ConsoleKernel` alongside `config['config_dir']`). |
| `.env` (file) | Loaded first from `$projectRoot/.env` via `EnvLoader::load()` before `config/waaseyaa.php`. `EnvLoader` writes to `putenv()`, `$_ENV`, and `$_SERVER` without overwriting keys already present in any of those stores (see source listing under Kernel Bootstrap file index). |

**Review note (assert / IO):** Layer 0 code may use `assert()` for internal invariants and file/stream helpers for logging, caches, or HTTP clients. Production should assume `zend.assertions` may be off; hot paths must not rely on assertions for security. When adding `file_put_contents`, `fopen`, `unserialize`, or `base64_decode` in Layer 0 packages, document the trust boundary (operator-only paths vs request-derived input) in package-level docblocks or this spec.

**Stored-payload `unserialize()` trust boundary (D-12):** Three Layer-0 stores deserialize object graphs — `Worker::processJob()` (`packages/queue/src/Worker/Worker.php`), `DatabaseBackend::mapRowToItem()` (`packages/cache`), and `SqlState::get()/getMultiple()` (`packages/state`). This is **intentional and cannot be tightened to `allowed_classes => false`**: queue messages are open-ended objects and cache/state values are `mixed`; a static allowlist would reject legitimate consumer classes. Every persistent payload is authenticated before `unserialize()`: cache uses `waaseyaa.cache.payload-hmac.v1`, queue and failed-job retry use `waaseyaa.queue.payload-hmac.v1`, and SQL state uses `waaseyaa.state.payload-hmac.v1`. Each HMAC-SHA-256 key is derived independently from `WAASEYAA_APP_SECRET`; versioned envelopes parse strictly and compare MACs with `hash_equals()`. Persistent queue/state readers accept authenticated envelopes only.

### DatabaseBootstrapper

File: `packages/foundation/src/Kernel/Bootstrap/DatabaseBootstrapper.php`
Class: `final class DatabaseBootstrapper`

```php
public function boot(string $projectRoot, array $config, ?LoggerInterface $logger = null): DatabaseInterface

public static function resolveDatabasePath(string $projectRoot, array $config): string
public static function absolutize(string $path, string $projectRoot): string
```

Creates `DBALDatabase::createSqlite()` using the canonical path resolution (`resolveDatabasePath()`): precedence `$config['database']` → `WAASEYAA_DB` env → `$projectRoot/storage/waaseyaa.sqlite` (unchanged), then **project-root absolutization** of the selected value (#1650 / FR-007, mission request-surface-hardening-01KTX7F2). In non-production environments, ensures the parent directory exists via `@mkdir()` (warning-suppressed — failure is expected in tests with inaccessible paths; SQLite will throw a proper exception downstream). The optional trailing `?LoggerInterface $logger = null` (Waaseyaa logger, `NullLogger` default — the framework's standard pattern) feeds the docroot warning below; `AbstractKernel::bootDatabase()` passes the kernel logger.

**Resolution matrix** (applied after precedence; `absolutize()` is the rule, mirrored verbatim by the CLI — see parity below):

| Selected value | Classified | Resolved to |
|---|---|---|
| *(unset — default)* | absolute | `{projectRoot}/storage/waaseyaa.sqlite` (byte-identical to before #1650) |
| `:memory:` | sentinel | `:memory:` (untouched; never warns) |
| `/var/db/app.sqlite` | absolute (leading `/`) | untouched |
| `C:\data\app.sqlite`, `C:/data/app.sqlite` | absolute (drive letter + separator) | untouched |
| `\\server\share\app.sqlite` | absolute (UNC) | untouched |
| `./storage/waaseyaa.sqlite` | relative (leading `./` stripped) | `{projectRoot}/storage/waaseyaa.sqlite` |
| `storage/waaseyaa.sqlite` | relative | `{projectRoot}/storage/waaseyaa.sqlite` |
| `../shared/db.sqlite` | relative (climbing) | `{projectRoot}/../shared/db.sqlite` |

**Invariant:** the resolved path is a pure function of (configured value, projectRoot) — **process CWD never participates**. `resolveDatabasePath()`'s sole production kernel callsite is `AbstractKernel::bootDatabase()`, which every runtime funnels through: HttpKernel (dev server / FPM / FrankenPHP; projectRoot = `dirname(public/)` from the front controller), ConsoleKernel (CLI; projectRoot = `getcwd()` validated against `composer.json`), and queue workers (CLI commands). With identical configuration, HTTP under a docroot CWD and the CLI under the project root open the **same file**; no stray database appears under the docroot (SC-004 — the #1650 two-databases dev trap). Deployments that relied on CWD-relative resolution change behavior deliberately (CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`, #1650).

**CLI parity:** `DbInitHandler::resolveDatabasePath()` delegates to the same static — its former divergent resolution (relative `config['database']` passed through verbatim; only `/`-prefixed strings recognized as absolute) is gone, so `db:init`'s reported and initialized path equals the kernel's resolved path for any configuration. The display surfaces `health:report` (`HealthReportHandler`) and `about` (`AboutHandler`) show the *resolved* path rather than the raw env value, so operators debugging #1650-class issues see what the kernel actually opens.

**Docroot warning (FR-008):** after resolution, `boot()` warns ⇔ resolved path ≠ `:memory:` ∧ the lexically normalized resolved path (separator unification + `.`/`..` segment resolution — deliberately **no** `realpath()`, the file may not exist yet at first boot) is contained in the normalized `{projectRoot}/public` (the framework's only docroot notion — the front controller location). Emitted once per boot at `warning` level, naming the resolved path and the docroot and advising a `WAASEYAA_DB`/`config['database']` correction — the SQLite file inside the docroot is one static-config mistake away from being a downloadable URL. **Boot always proceeds** — the warning never throws or aborts, and a kernel constructed without a logger boots silently. Best-effort advisory, not a security boundary (a symlinked docroot may evade the lexical check).

Production safety contract:
- environment resolution matches the kernel contract: config `'environment'` key → `APP_ENV` env var → `'production'`
- when the resolved environment is `production`, file-backed SQLite paths must already exist before boot continues
- if the resolved production SQLite file is missing, bootstrap throws `RuntimeException` naming `bin/waaseyaa db:init` as the sanctioned first-deploy path (`Database not found at {path}. In production, the database must already exist. Run "bin/waaseyaa db:init" to create the database file and apply migrations. The command is idempotent and safe to run on every deploy.`). The guard itself is unchanged; `db:init` bypasses it by running through the minimal-console path (see `ConsoleKernel::shouldUseMinimalConsole()` and the `DbInitCommand` reference below).
- when that production guard fires, bootstrap does not create the parent directory as a side effect
- non-production environments (`local`, `dev`, `development`, `testing`, etc.) keep the existing auto-create behavior
- `:memory:` remains allowed in all environments for explicit in-memory bootstrap/test cases

### ManifestBootstrapper

File: `packages/foundation/src/Kernel/Bootstrap/ManifestBootstrapper.php`
Class: `final class ManifestBootstrapper`

```php
public function boot(string $projectRoot): PackageManifest
```

Instantiates `PackageManifestCompiler` with `storagePath: $projectRoot . '/storage'` and calls `load()` (cache-first, compile on miss).

`storage/framework/packages.php` includes metadata key `_manifest_inputs_fp`: an `xxh128` digest of the raw contents of the project `composer.json` and `vendor/composer/installed.json`. When present and not equal to a freshly computed digest, `load()` discards the cache and recompiles (covers new/removed Composer packages and copied stale caches). After loading a cached manifest, `assertProvidersExist()` validates that all declared provider classes can be autoloaded. If any are missing, the manifest auto-recovers by logging a warning and recompiling from disk, no manual `optimize:manifest` needed. `StaleManifestException` is still thrown by `assertProvidersExist()` but is caught internally by `load()` as a recompile trigger. If the recompiled manifest still contains missing providers (e.g., stale `composer.json` declarations), `load()` logs an error with actionable remediation guidance, stamps the missing provider list into the cache via `_known_missing_providers`, and returns the manifest without rethrowing. On subsequent requests, `validateCachedProviders()` compares the current missing set against the stamped known-missing set: if they match, recompilation is skipped (only an error is logged). If `composer.json` changes (fingerprint mismatch), the stamp is naturally cleared by a fresh compile. This prevents repeated full-compile cost on every request when a provider is permanently misconfigured (#9). If the stamp cannot be persisted (missing cache file, write failure), `stampKnownMissing()` logs a warning so operators can diagnose why recompilation continues.

The compiled manifest now also carries `packageDeclarations`, derived from package-local `composer.json` metadata and merged installed-package metadata. This is the post-M10 baseline used to normalize provider ownership and to verify that declared provider classes still exist before the manifest is trusted.

On every successful cache read, root `extra.waaseyaa` **providers** and **permissions** are merged again from `composer.json` so a structurally valid cache cannot omit app-level declarations that match the current fingerprint. Composer keys `extra.waaseyaa.commands` and `extra.waaseyaa.routes` are **deprecated**: they are not compiled into `PackageManifest`, and `PackageManifest::fromArray()` ignores legacy `commands`/`routes` keys if present in an older `packages.php`. The compiler logs a warning when any installed package or root `composer.json` still declares those keys (see `docs/adr/0001-manifest-routes-commands-removal.md`). HTTP routes and console commands are owned by `ServiceProvider::routes()` / `ServiceProvider::commands()` and the core CLI registry — not the manifest lists.

### ProviderRegistry

File: `packages/foundation/src/Kernel/Bootstrap/ProviderRegistry.php`
Class: `final class ProviderRegistry`

Constructor: `(LoggerInterface $logger)`

```php
public function discoverAndRegister(
    PackageManifest $manifest,
    string $projectRoot,
    array $config,
    EntityTypeManager $entityTypeManager,
    DatabaseInterface $database,
    EventDispatcherInterface $dispatcher,
): array  // list<ServiceProvider>
```

Discovery and registration follows a multi-phase process:

1. **Instantiation**: Each provider class from `$manifest->providers` is instantiated. Missing classes are logged with actionable remediation guidance (fix `composer.json` or run `optimize:manifest`) and skipped. Non-`ServiceProvider` instances are also logged and skipped.
2. **Context injection**: Each provider receives kernel context via `setKernelContext($projectRoot, $config, $manifest->formatters)` and a kernel resolver closure via `setKernelResolver()`. The resolver provides cross-provider DI — it resolves `EntityTypeManager`, `DatabaseInterface`, `EventDispatcherInterface`, `LoggerInterface`, and any binding registered by previously-loaded providers.
3. **Registration**: `register()` is called on each provider, allowing them to bind interfaces to implementations.
4. **Entity type collection**: After all providers register, entity types from `$provider->getEntityTypeRegistrations()` are registered with the `EntityTypeManager` together with the provider class that declared them. Generic registration failures are still logged as errors. `EntityTypeRegistrationCollisionException` is special-cased: the failure is logged and then rethrown so duplicate or shadow registrations stop boot deterministically.
5. **Provider-owned surfaces**: Route and command ownership stays with the package provider or package registry that declared it. Foundation now declares only its own baseline provider (`Waaseyaa\Foundation\FoundationServiceProvider`), while package-level providers such as `ApiServiceProvider`, `UserServiceProvider`, and `McpServiceProvider` own their respective HTTP surfaces.

The method returns the full list of instantiated providers. Handles instantiation failures gracefully with error logging.

### AccessPolicyRegistry

File: `packages/foundation/src/Kernel/Bootstrap/AccessPolicyRegistry.php`
Class: `final class AccessPolicyRegistry`

Constructor: `(LoggerInterface $logger)`

```php
public function discover(PackageManifest $manifest): EntityAccessHandler
```

Reads `$manifest->policies` (keyed by class name → entity type list), instantiates each policy class, and returns a wired `EntityAccessHandler`. Uses reflection heuristic: policies with required constructor parameters are inspected — if the first parameter is typed `array` (e.g., `ConfigEntityAccessPolicy`), the entity type list is passed; if the first parameter is a service type (e.g., `EntityTypeManagerInterface`), the policy cannot be auto-instantiated and is skipped with an error log (register it manually in your service provider instead). No-arg policies are instantiated directly. Missing classes and instantiation failures are logged, not fatal.

## Symfony decoupling (mission 1107)

Mission 1107-api-symfony-decoupling introduces three Waaseyaa-owned framework surfaces wrapping Symfony primitives. Per the ratified Path R-narrow charter, the mission scope is **HTTP request/response and event-dispatch only** — routing internals stay Symfony-coupled.

### Public types (app code)

| Waaseyaa surface | Wraps | Ratified contract |
|---|---|---|
| `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Http\Request` | `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request` (class alias) | C-002 (a) |
| `Waaseyaa\Api\Http\JsonApiResponse` | `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse` (subclass) | C-001 (a) |
| `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Event\EventDispatcherInterface` | PSR-14 + Symfony-style listener / subscriber methods | C-003 (a) |

The default binding for `EventDispatcherInterface` is `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Event\SymfonyEventDispatcherAdapter`, instantiated by `AbstractKernel::boot()` and exposed via `getEventDispatcher(): EventDispatcherInterface`. The adapter implements both Waaseyaa's interface and Symfony's component `EventDispatcherInterface`, so framework-internal call sites that still type-hint Symfony continue to accept the same instance — the abstraction added without forcing a foundation-wide type-hint sweep.

### Framework-internal contract (C-003)

`Waaseyaa\Foundation\Event\DomainEvent` continues to `extends \Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\Event`. Only the dispatcher gains a Waaseyaa-owned interface; event subclasses still inherit Symfony's `Event` via `DomainEvent`. This is an **explicit framework-internal contract**: the Symfony parent class is part of foundation's stable surface and changing it is a major-version concern. Subscriber-discovery semantics also stay Symfony-typed (`Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface`) — the mission's surface-area calculus deliberately keeps these standard so existing subscriber idioms work unchanged.

This closes drift flag **D4** ("DomainEvent extends Symfony Event is an undocumented public surface") raised in the mission decomposition.

### Trait ownership (amended C-004)

The canonical JSON:API response trait is `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Http\JsonApiResponseTrait`. Its 9 in-package consumers (HttpKernel, ControllerDispatcher, 7 routers) plus 4 cross-layer consumers (graphql, ssr×2, media) make it the natural canonical home. The previous duplicate `Waaseyaa\Api\JsonResponseTrait` (a plain JSON helper, not a JSON:API helper) was deleted as orphan; api consumers that need typed responses now construct `Waaseyaa\Api\Http\JsonApiResponse` directly. L4 → L0 imports of foundation's trait are allowed by the layer rule.

### Out of scope (Path R-narrow)

- **Routing decoupling.** `Symfony\Component\Routing\Route` continues to leak through `RouteBuilder` public signatures. App code that registers routes via service providers will still import Symfony's Route after this mission lands. Filed as a follow-up mission `routing-symfony-decoupling` (referenced from `#1107` at acceptance).
- **Bimaaji decoupling.** Independent surface; out of scope for this mission.
- **Symfony-import boundary linter.** Per ratified C-005 (b), the `bin/check-symfony-imports` script is deferred to a follow-up issue — the soft-rot tradeoff is documented there. Until that linter ships, the mission's executable contract is `packages/api/tests/Contract/SymfonyImportBoundaryTest`, which asserts a sample app-controller fixture produces a JSON:API response without `use Symfony\` imports.

## Implementation gotchas

- **Backward-compatible cache evolution**: When adding new properties to cached manifests/configs, make them optional in deserialization (use `$data['key'] ?? []`) to avoid breaking old cached files.
- **`PackageManifestCompiler` prefers optimized autoloader**: `scanClasses()` tries `autoload_classmap.php` first, then falls back to PSR-4 directory scanning with a warning log. The classmap under default `composer install` has Composer/polyfill entries but no `Waaseyaa\` classes — the fallback triggers on missing Waaseyaa entries, not an empty classmap. Run `composer dump-autoload --optimize` for faster, more reliable discovery.
- **Kernel Bootstrap directory**: Extracted bootstrappers live in `packages/foundation/src/Kernel/Bootstrap/` — `DatabaseBootstrapper`, `ManifestBootstrapper`, `ProviderRegistry`, `AccessPolicyRegistry`. AbstractKernel delegates to these.
- **Debug boot guard**: `AbstractKernel::boot()` throws `RuntimeException` if `isDebugMode()` is true and `isDevelopmentMode()` is false. Both methods and the boot guard use `resolveEnvironment()` as the single canonical source for `APP_ENV` resolution. Tests that boot with `debug => true` in config must also set `APP_ENV=local`.
- **Kernel boot flag ordering**: `AbstractKernel::boot()` sets `$this->booted = true` *after* all initialization steps succeed. Setting it before would create a zombie state where boot failure prevents retry. If adding new boot steps, add them before the flag assignment.
- **Migration system boot order**: `bootMigrations()` runs after `compileManifest()` (requires `PackageManifest`) and before `discoverAndRegisterProviders()`. It reuses the DBAL `Connection` from `DBALDatabase` (via `getConnection()`) — single connection, no duplication.
- **`ServiceProvider` has no `$dispatcher` property**: Event subscriber registration must resolve the dispatcher via `$this->resolve(...)` and check `instanceof Waaseyaa\Foundation\Event\EventDispatcherInterface` before calling `addListener()`/`addSubscriber()`. Historically (before G-025 / #1940) `ProviderRegistryKernelServices::get()` served the dispatcher under exactly one FQCN, `\Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface`; resolving the foundation FQCN or the Symfony *Component* FQCN instead returned null (`resolveOptional()`) or threw (`resolve()`) in a real kernel boot — no exception surfaced at the `addListener()`/`addSubscriber()` call site, the registration just silently never happened. This exact bug shipped and was found live in four providers: relationship's delete guard (#1852), and — swept in WP4 (audit-remediation batch 2026-07-01/02) — field's classification-label lifecycle subscriber, and two ai-observability telemetry providers. As of G-025 (#1940) the bus additionally serves the dispatcher under `Psr\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface` and `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Event\EventDispatcherInterface` (same instance) — see the kernel-services bus table above — closing the foundation-FQCN half of this trap; the Symfony *Component* FQCN (`Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface`) is still unserved. `bin/check-dispatcher-keys` (wired into `composer verify`, baseline at `tools/dispatcher-key-baseline.txt`) predates this fix and still treats only the Symfony-contracts FQCN as served; its `SERVED_DISPATCHER_FQCN` constant and script-header comment are stale post-G-025 and are tracked as a follow-up, not corrected in this change.
- **`RateLimiter`: check before hit**: Always call `tooManyAttempts()` BEFORE `hit()`. Calling `hit()` first counts the current request before checking, reducing the effective limit by 1.
