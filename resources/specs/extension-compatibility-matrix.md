# Extension Compatibility Matrix (v1.0-v1.3)

## Policy

- Runtime contract additions must be additive.
- Existing stable payload fields may not be removed or renamed without a major version transition.
- Legacy aliases remain supported until explicitly deprecated and replacement path is documented.

## Surface Matrix

| Surface | Introduced | Status | Compatibility Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCP `tools/call` stable meta (`contract_version`, `contract_stability`, `tool`, `tool_invoked`) | v1.0 | Stable | Must remain backward compatible |
| MCP alias normalization (`search_teachings` -> `search_entities`) | v1.0 | Stable | Alias retained; canonical tool contract unchanged |
| MCP read-path caching (transparent) | v1.1 | Stable | Must not change tool payload shape |
| Plugin extension interface (`KnowledgeToolingExtensionInterface`) | v1.2 | Stable | Method signatures additive-only |
| Plugin extension runner (`KnowledgeToolingExtensionRunner`) | v1.2 | Stable | Ordered deterministic execution required |
| Extension SDK scaffold (`scaffold:extension`) | v1.3 | Stable | Scaffold payload keys and template contract versioned |
| Kernel bootstrap seam (`extensions.plugin_directories`) | v1.3 | Stable | Empty/default config preserves prior behavior |
| MCP extension diagnostics in `tools/introspect` | v1.3 | Stable additive | Additive introspection-only; `tools/call` unchanged |

## Required Contract Tests

- MCP stable meta compatibility under extension registration.
- Kernel extension runner bootstrap fallback behavior (configured + empty).
- Extension SDK scaffold deterministic payload and validation paths.
- Cross-repo harness execution with auditable artifact output.

## Package Layer Table

This is the canonical, package-level mirror of the seven-layer architecture enforced by `bin/check-package-layers`. The `LAYER_BY_SHORT` map in the script and the "Layer Architecture" row in `CLAUDE.md` mirror this table; when the three disagree, this matrix is authoritative. Mission #824 WP02 surfaces A–E ratify the contents below.

**Total: 62 PHP packages** across 7 layers (18 / 9 / 10 / 7 / 3 / 5 / 10).

### Footnotes

1. **`packages/admin/` (Nuxt SPA, no `composer.json`).** Excluded from the PHP layer graph. The admin frontend is a TypeScript/Vue project (Nuxt 3); its PHP host is `waaseyaa/admin-surface` (L6). Verified by mission #824 WP02 surface D: zero PHP files under the tree, no inbound `require waaseyaa/admin` from any first-party manifest.
2. **Metapackages (`cms`, `core`, `full`).** Aggregator manifests with `type: metapackage`. Skipped by `bin/check-package-layers` and not assigned a layer; they re-export combinations of the packages above.
3. **Kernel exemption surface.** Layer rules are enforced at two levels: (a) `composer.json` runtime `require` edges (`PL003`/`PL004`), and (b) PHP file-level `use` imports (`PL005`). Kernel-adjacent files are exempted via `KERNEL_EXEMPT_DIR_SUFFIXES` (implicit, `<pkg>/src/Kernel/`) and `KERNEL_EXEMPT_FILES` (explicit named-file allowlist). See `docs/specs/infrastructure.md` "Kernel exemption surface (named files)".

### Synchronization

When adding or reclassifying a first-party package, update **all three** sources together:

| Source | Role |
|---|---|
| `bin/check-package-layers` (`LAYER_BY_SHORT`) | Executable enforcement |
| This table | Package-level source of truth |
| `CLAUDE.md` "Layer Architecture" | Session-hot human-readable summary |

The three must agree. The gate ratifies the agreement on every CI run: `PL002` fires on any directory whose `composer.json` declares a `waaseyaa/*` name missing from `LAYER_BY_SHORT`.
