# Entity System

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-19 - Sheguiandah gap batch: EntityValueContainer gains internal rawProjection(list<string>) for closed, fixed-shape authorities. It releases only the named values through the existing RestrictedEntityValue view binding, never exports the whole value bag, and is consumed through hard-coded EntityBase-bound projectors by the relationship directory; ordinary get()/toArray()/serialization and missing-context behavior are unchanged. Canonical authorization contract: entity-field-read-boundary.md. -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-17 - #2064 WP1 adds dormant FieldReadLevel metadata, immutable EntityStructure, preflight data/result skeletons, and the future EntitySerializationForbidden type. No EntityBase accessor, toArray(), serialization, hydration, query, or boot path is wired or changed. Canonical contract: entity-field-read-boundary.md. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-02 - #2171 `FieldAccessPreflightData::CURRENT_SCANNER_VERSION` (currently 2) is now a contract, not a recorded value. The scanner generation determines WHAT a preflight swept — v2 narrowed the schema fingerprint from every physical table to entity storage only (#2143) — so an artifact from a different generation answers a different question than the running framework asks. `scanner_version` was previously parsed and never compared; because it sits inside `canonicalData()` a hand-edited value was caught by the checksum, but an artifact legitimately produced by another generation is self-consistent and its fingerprint can coincide where the two table sets match. `FieldAccessActivationPreflight::assertReady()` now refuses any mismatch in BOTH directions: a newer artifact is as unverifiable as an older one. Bump the constant when the MEANING of a scan changes, not when its implementation does. Correction to the #2171 report: the pre-existing missing/malformed/framework-version/schema-fingerprint/checksum/readiness checks already failed CLOSED and are unchanged. Acceptance: FieldAccessActivationFailsClosedTest. -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-14 - #2018 authoring spine: integer fields with settings.subtype=timestamp now derive AtLeastOneOf(Type(int), Type(DateTimeInterface)) so unix-backed storage values and cast-aware domain values are both valid while unrelated scalar/container types remain rejected. This corrects the documented cast-aware validation contract; no validation path is disabled. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-21 - #2101 WP-3: taxonomy hierarchy remains guarded at EntityRepository's PRE_SAVE boundary, while taxonomy_term.vid now carries an additive restrictive foreign key to taxonomy_vocabulary.vid so direct, batch, and concurrent vocabulary deletes cannot orphan terms. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-21 - #2101 minor sweep / #2089: menu_link object destinations are stored independently from presentation title as optional public target_entity_type + target_entity_id fields; title-only JSON:API updates must preserve both fields, while URL links and the browsing-context target field remain unchanged. The enabled field declares its true domain default in metadata so schema-driven create forms match new MenuLink instances. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-20 - #2088: menu_link now declares menu as its bundle config entity and exposes its complete authoring fields, including browsing-context target; explicitly empty bundle registrations remain visible to schema consumers. -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-13 - CW-v1 option-1 PR-4 (#1920, security): new `Waaseyaa\Entity\Write\EntityWritePayloadGuard` (`packages/entity/src/Write/EntityWritePayloadGuard.php`, `@api`) — the write-side field allowlist shared by JSON:API/admin-surface/GraphQL. No entity-system storage/save-load contract changes; it is a pure, stateless read of `EntityTypeInterface::getKeys()` + `EntityTypeManagerInterface::resolveFieldDefinitions()` (both pre-existing, unchanged read paths documented elsewhere in this spec). Full contract documented in `docs/specs/api-layer.md` "Write-side field allowlist (CW-v1 option-1 PR-4)", the surface that actually calls it. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-02 - audit-remediation batch R2 WP1 (anonymous SQL injection via unvalidated filter/sort field name reaching a raw json_extract() interpolation): new "SQL identifier hardening (audit R2 WP1)" paragraph under Query Pipeline -> SqlEntityQuery documents the shared Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Query\JsonFieldName::assertQueryable() guard added at BOTH json_extract sinks — SqlEntityQuery::resolveField() (three sites, getQuery()->execute() path) AND its twin SqlStorageDriver::resolveField() (EntityRepository::findBy()/count() path, live via ai-tools EntityListTool). Storage/save-load contracts unchanged; primary API-layer fix (the JSON:API field allowlist) documented in docs/specs/api-layer.md. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-02 - audit-remediation WP4 (#1859) dead-subscriber sweep, field package touches: FieldServiceProvider::boot() re-keyed its classification EntityLifecycleSubscriber registration from the foundation dispatcher FQCN (never served by the kernel-services bus — the listener silently registered NOTHING in a real boot) to the served Symfony-contracts FQCN (#1852 pattern), so classification label resolution/inheritance now actually runs on entity saves in production for the first time; and EntityLifecycleSubscriber's write-back is now hygiene-guarded — it no longer writes stray all-null classification keys into every entity's value bag (→ _data blob) on types with no classification involvement (writes only when there is something real to record or clear; clears still write + audit). No entity-pipeline/storage/save-load contract change — the full behavioral description lives in docs/specs/classification-and-retention.md, and the new bin/check-dispatcher-keys gate (documented in infrastructure.md) prevents future unserved-FQCN registrations. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-01 - C-22 WP4 (delete the legacy save engine entirely, spec-reviewed: entity-system.md — C-22 WP4 deletes SqlEntityStorage/EntityStorageFactory): packages/entity-storage/src/SqlEntityStorage.php and EntityStorageFactory.php are deleted outright — EntityRepository is now the framework's only persistence engine. EntityStorageInterface stays (RevisionableStorageInterface extends it as dormant public API; several test doubles implement it directly), as do the shared SqlEntityQuery/BundleSubtableGateway/SqlStorageDriver/EntityInstantiator classes EntityRepository itself builds on — none of those were SqlEntityStorage-only. EntityTypeManager::getStorage()/EntityTypeManagerInterface::getStorage() are kept (interface-breaking removal would affect EntityStorageInterface's other users) but the kernel (EntityTypeManagerFactory) no longer supplies a storageFactory closure and EntityType::fromClass()'s $storageClass default changed from 'Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\SqlEntityStorage' to '' — getStorage() now throws for every first-party entity type unless a caller supplies their own EntityStorageInterface implementation; it is a dormant "bring your own engine" seam, not a supported path. 5 dead-code baseline entries for the deleted classes' methods removed (the methods no longer exist). SqlStorageDriver gains an optional FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface param (K2 write/read symmetry fix for FieldStorage::Data fields, issue #1308 — without it EntityRepository would have regressed a correctness guarantee SqlEntityStorage used to provide). EntityRepository::doSave() had a pre-existing bug surfaced by this WP's test conversions: the new-entity id-backfill branch read `$entity->id() ?? ''`, which never sees "unassigned" for entity classes like User whose id() accessor coerces null to a non-null sentinel (0, the AnonymousUser id) — newly-created Users could silently keep uid=0 instead of their real assigned id. Fixed by reading the id key from the entity's raw toArray() value bag instead. Test suite: the WP1 behavior-identity harness (tests/Integration/PhaseN/EntityStorageEngineParity/) is deleted — its sole purpose was pinning cross-engine parity during the WP1-WP4 migration window, and there is nothing left to compare with one engine. ~55 test files across packages/entity-storage/tests/ and top-level tests/ converted from SqlEntityStorage-based fixture seeding to EntityRepository rather than dropped (several renamed for clarity, e.g. EntityRepositoryBundleFieldsTest.php, EntityRepositorySqlCrudTest.php). One accepted coverage/behavior loss: SqlEntityStorage's load-side "MISSING_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE" notice (mergeBundleSubtableRow/mergeBundleSubtableRowsBatch) had no EntityRepository equivalent — EntityRepository's load path silently skips a missing bundle subtable with no operator-facing notice (the save-side notice, the more load-bearing one since it signals actual data-placement decisions, is preserved). See "The legacy save engine is gone (C-22)" § below and docs/notes/c22-consumer-inventory.md §7. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-01 - C-22 WP3 (migrate read/write consumers off getStorage(), spec-reviewed: entity-system.md — C-22 WP3 completes the getStorage()→getRepository() consumer migration): every production load()/loadMultiple()/create()/save()/delete()/loadByKey() callsite across ~25 packages now goes through getRepository() instead of getStorage(). EntityRepositoryInterface gains create(array $values = []): EntityInterface (additive), sharing EntityInstantiator::applyFieldDefinitionDefaults() with SqlEntityStorage::create() so both engines apply the same field defaults; parity proven by tests/Integration/PhaseN/EntityStorageEngineParity/CreateFieldDefaultsParityTest.php. loadByKey() callsites (ForgotPasswordController, RegisterController, ClassificationLabelRegistry, GenericAdminSurfaceHost) became a bounded getQuery()->accessCheck(false)->condition(key,value)->range(0,1)->execute() + find(). SessionMiddleware/BearerAuthMiddleware/NoteIngester/OidcClientSeeder/OidcClientLookup constructors narrowed from EntityStorageInterface to EntityRepositoryInterface. Behavior change: JsonApiController::update()'s no-expectation PATCH branch now saves via getRepository() (cuts a revision on revisionable types) instead of the legacy getStorage() path — see api-layer.md and the archived optimistic-locking-01KTXCHY contract's superseded clause 14. SqlEntityStorage's create/load/loadByKey/loadMultiple/save/delete and EntityStorageFactory::getStorage are now confirmed dead by the dead-code gate (baselined, pending deletion in C-22 WP4). See "Two save engines" § below. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-30 - C-22 (remove-legacy-save-engine prerequisite, additive): EntityRepositoryInterface gains getQuery(): EntityQueryInterface, and EntityRepository::getQuery() now builds the SAME access-checked SqlEntityQuery that SqlEntityStorage::getQuery() builds — same query construction, same lazily-resolved EntityAccessHandler (threaded by EntityTypeManagerFactory via the same accessHandlerResolver closure both engines share), same fail-closed setAccount() contract (unbound account → MissingQueryAccountException on execute()), same id-keyed entity loader matching SqlEntityStorage::loadMultiple()'s shape so the per-row check($entity,'view',$account) filter is identical. Two optional trailing EntityRepository ctor params carry the handler (?EntityAccessHandler $accessHandler, ?\Closure $accessHandlerResolver). Strictly additive — SqlEntityStorage/EntityStorageFactory unchanged and still wired; no consumers migrated; save/find behaviour unchanged; both engines keep working. getQuery() is a new method on the @api EntityRepositoryInterface (external implementers must add it; first-party test doubles updated). Unblocks migrating the ~20 getStorage()->getQuery() callsites off the legacy engine (inventory: docs/notes/c22-consumer-inventory.md). Acceptance: RepositoryStorageQueryParityTest (parity: both surfaces fail closed identically without an account, and return the same access-filtered id set for an account-bound query) + the existing EntityQueryAccessCheck suite + kernel-booting integration. See "Two save engines" §. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-29 - database-legacy WP6 (#1816, entity-storage read-path follow-through): SqlEntityQuery::resolveField() and SqlStorageDriver::resolveField() now return a ResolvedField value object (packages/entity-storage/src/ResolvedField.php; sql()/isExpression()/isJsonExtract()) instead of a bare SQL string. Plain/qualified columns are BARE identifiers (no longer pre-quoted) routed through SelectInterface::condition()/orderBy()/isNull()/isNotNull(), which now auto-quote $field via the platform quoteIdentifier; json_extract(_data,...) fields are expressions routed through the new whereRaw()/orderByRaw() seams (emitted verbatim). The K3 CAST(json_extract(...) AS TEXT) IN-set casting is preserved inside whereRaw() and now gates on ResolvedField::isJsonExtract() (the string-scan expressionResolvesViaJsonExtract() helper was removed). Closes the last SQL-injection vector in the entity read engine. Storage/save-load and access contracts unchanged. See infrastructure.md "Identifier quoting" for the database-legacy seam contract. Acceptance: entity-storage query suites (json_extract filter/sort + K3) + IdentifierQuotingTest, all green. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-23 - audit C-24 train 3: removed the stale ValueCaster sentence describing CastTokenMapper::toDataType()/TypedDataManager — ValueCaster never called CastTokenMapper (it delegates only to EntityCastCoercion/CoercionException, unchanged), and CastTokenMapper + TypedDataManager were deleted in train 3 as dead typed-data ancestry. See infrastructure.md for the typed-data removal. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-23 - audit C-24 train 2 (field item-layer removal, BREAKING pre-1.0): the dead Drupal-lineage Field-API item/value-object layer is removed. Gone: FieldItemBase, FieldItemInterface, FieldItemListInterface (public @api), ComputedFieldInterface (internal), FieldItemList, PropertyValue, ComputedItem (the 'computed' field type). The 16 remaining #[FieldType] plugins reparented from FieldItemBase to AbstractFieldType (now @api public base; flipped from internal in T1), and their dead instance-contract statics propertyDefinitions()/mainPropertyName() removed. The live static seam (schema/jsonSchema/defaultSettings/defaultValue/jsonSchemaFor/schemaFor) + FieldTypeInterface unchanged → FieldTypeManager resolution byte-identical. Entity field values still flow through ContentEntityBase's _data/$values path (no item-object layer; docblock corrected). Prove-dead: no production path instantiated a field-type plugin; full Unit suite 8617 green confirms nothing live depended on the removed layer. No BC shim (pre-1.0). Custom field types extend AbstractFieldType (UPGRADING.md). Train 3 retires the now-unused typed-data ancestry. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-23 - audit C-24 train 1 (field item-layer deprecation): behaviour-preserving internal refactor of the field package, no contract/behaviour change. The live static field-type "descriptor" seam (defaultSettings/defaultValue/jsonSchemaFor/schemaFor) was extracted off the dead FieldItemBase instance/value-object layer into a new @internal abstract base Waaseyaa\Field\AbstractFieldType (which FieldItemBase now extends, so the seam is single-sourced and inherited unchanged). FieldTypeManager still resolves every field-type plugin via $class::method() — identical output, proven by FieldTypeStaticSeamResolutionTest (all discovered types resolve + reach the seam via AbstractFieldType) and the full field suite (480 tests). No field-type plugin reparented yet and no surface removed — train 2 reparents the plugins onto AbstractFieldType and removes the dead instance layer + its tests; train 3 retires the now-unused typed-data ancestry. Scoping: docs/audits/c24-field-item-layer-deprecation-scoping.md. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-23 - audit C-6 (#1714 follow-through): the entity query layer is now deny-by-default. SqlEntityQuery::filterCandidates() survivor test flipped from !isForbidden() (admitted Allowed AND Neutral) to isAllowed(), so a Neutral row ("no policy granted a view") is dropped, not admitted; count() inherits this. The empty/unwired-handler fallback now denies every candidate (fail-closed) instead of returning the unfiltered window — closing the open-by-default primitive. Production wiring (the #1714 accessHandlerResolver) is unchanged; the fallback is reached only by direct construction or a missing resolver. The full enforcement-layer contract lives in docs/specs/access-control.md (Layer 3, updated in the same PR); entity-system pipeline/storage/save-load contracts are unchanged. Genealogy SSR (a surfaced pre-existing prod defect) now gathers relationship topology via accessCheck(false) with per-person gate concealment so living/private relatives render as redacted placeholders rather than vanishing. Acceptance: SqlEntityQueryDeniesNeutralRowTest + GraphQL/discovery/semantic/genealogy integration suites. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-22 - WP16 (alpha245 security, issue #1714): SqlEntityStorage::getQuery() is now fail-closed in production wiring. resolveAccessHandler() falls back to an EMPTY EntityAccessHandler when none is wired (check() returns Neutral → !isForbidden() admits every row), and both build sites (AbstractKernel storage closure, EntityStorageFactory) built storage with accessHandler=null → fail-OPEN. SqlEntityStorage gains an optional `?\Closure(): ?EntityAccessHandler $accessHandlerResolver`; getQuery() resolves the handler from `accessHandler ?? resolver()` at QUERY time (an explicit handler still wins) — resolving lazily means a storage built/cached mid-boot, before the kernel's handler is populated, still wires the real handler at runtime. EntityStorageFactory gains the same optional resolver param (default null = unfiltered, system-context only). accessCheck(false) bypass and the missing-account fail-closed throw are unchanged. Acceptance: EntityStorageFactoryAccessWiringTest::{factory_wired_storage_getQuery_filters_forbidden_rows, unwired_factory_storage_is_fail_open_documenting_the_pre_fix_gap} + the kernel-booting integration suite (962, WP05/WP06 access paths unaffected). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-22 - WP13 (classification security, audit #18/#19): two field/classification fixes. (1) PurgeJob now enforces a hard legal-hold guard — a `hold-*` classification label is NEVER purged, regardless of policy match. The class doc asserted this held "by construction" (purge policies use action=purge, holds use action=hold-flag), but a misconfigured purge policy whose `applies_to` glob matched `hold-*` (e.g. `hold-*` or `*`) would otherwise delete legal-hold content; the invariant is now enforced in code (`str_starts_with($labelId, 'hold-')` skip) so it cannot be configured away. (2) FieldServiceProvider now wires the `classification.role_clearance` config into RoleBasedClearanceChecker — the binding previously did `new RoleBasedClearanceChecker()` with no argument, so the host override was silently ignored and clearance was permanently the stock DEFAULT_ROLE_CLEARANCE; the checker still falls back to that default when no override is present. Acceptance: PurgeJobTest::never_purges_legal_hold_labelled_entities_even_when_a_policy_matches + FieldServiceProviderClearanceConfigTest::honours_the_classification_role_clearance_override (both proven to fail against the pre-fix code). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-21 - issue #1706 (revision-id allocation race, P1-4): VERIFIED + closed. RevisionableStorageDriver allocates revision ids via getNextRevisionId/getNextLangcodeRevisionId = MAX(revision_id)+1, which is NOT atomic — two concurrent writers for the same key can read the same MAX. The composite PRIMARY KEY (entity_id, revision_id) [and (entity_id, langcode, revision_id) for the two-axis translation revision table] is the integrity backstop: it makes assigning the SAME revision id twice structurally impossible (a concurrent duplicate is rejected by the DB, never silently stored), so the held P1-4 concern ("can two concurrent inserts be assigned the same revision id?") does NOT hold. The residual was liveness: the losing writer's INSERT raised the unique-constraint violation to the caller. Fix: both writeDefaultRevision and writePerLangcodeRevision now wrap allocate-and-insert in a bounded retry (MAX_REVISION_ALLOCATION_ATTEMPTS = 5) that catches the unique-constraint violation, re-reads MAX, and retries the next id; a genuine persistent conflict still surfaces after the bound. Single-threaded the loop runs once (behavior unchanged). Acceptance: RevisionIdAllocationRaceTest (a concurrent-steal decorator proves the duplicate is rejected AND the loser advances to the next id; proven to fail against the pre-retry code). Optimistic locking (SaveContext expectedRevisionId / RevisionConflictException, #1647) is a separate, higher seam and is unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-12 - hotfixes #1653/#1654/#1655 (post-alpha.207 adoption fixes): (1) SqlSchemaHandler::ensureRevisionAuthorColumn() now issues a targeted guarded ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN instead of DBALSchema::addField() — whole-schema introspection broke getRepository() on databases containing FTS5 virtual tables (typeless shadow-table columns crash DBAL 4.4's SQLite column parser); behavior otherwise identical, fieldExists guard retained. (2) The optimistic-locking pre-check accepts ContentEntityBase revisionables via a getRevisionId duck-check fallback — the legacy RevisionableInterface instanceof gate alone made expectations unusable on the common base class (instanceof RevisionableInterface remains a deliberate behavioral signal elsewhere: migration setNewRevision, revision-log capture). (3) FieldDefinitionConstraintBuilder's boolean arm derives Choice([true, false, 0, 1]) instead of Type('bool') — the framework's own boolean convention stores 0/1 through get()/validate (see User.php status comment; User::setActive() writes ints), and Type('bool') rejected it; companion: User::email_verified declared required: false (the NotNull inference from the non-nullable property predates live validation and no write path supplies the field). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-12 - mission optimistic-locking-01KTXCHY WP03 (#1647): repository save-contract addendum — SaveContext::withExpectedRevisionId() optimistic-locking expectation on the save pipeline (conflict check after validation, before preSave/events; RevisionConflictException vs the LogicException rejection family; no-expectation saves byte-identical), RevisionConflictException added to the entity-storage exception inventory, full mechanics delegated to revision-system-unified.md §3b. ALSO clears the standing Mission 3 drift flag: EntityType `discoverable: bool = true` flag cross-referenced (one-liner under EntityTypeInterface; api-layer.md stays canonical for discovery, mission request-surface-hardening-01KTX7F2 #1649). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-12 - mission live-entity-validation-key-protection-01KTWQT3 (#1643, alpha.204): save-time validation is now kernel-wired and ON by default for every kernel-built repository (shared EntityValidator::createDefault()); boot-time opt-out via WAASEYAA_ENTITY_VALIDATION=0|false|off, per-call opt-out via save(..., validate: false). FieldDefinitionConstraintBuilder gains the Range arm (numeric min/max settings on integer/float fields) and now appends per-field declared FieldDefinition::getConstraints() after the derived list. The previous "validates only when an EntityValidator is injected" caveat is resolved — injection is the default. See "Field definitions -> constraints" below for the three-layer constraint source table and the pre-persistence/saveMany-rollback guarantees. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-04 - PR #1614 (page-builder + real content types): per-bundle typed fields land. `EntityTypeManagerInterface` gains `resolveFieldDefinitions(entityTypeId, ?bundle)` as the single bundle-aware field-resolution path (class `#[Field]` attributes + registry core fields + registry bundle fields), plus `addBundleFields()` which auto-materializes a per-bundle subtable (e.g. `node__page`) with real typed columns. New `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Bundle\BundleSubtableGateway` is the single bundle-persistence implementation used by BOTH `EntityRepository` (the migration/canonical write path) and `SqlEntityStorage` (the `getStorage()` admin/API path); `SqlEntityStorage`'s inline partition/upsert/read was removed so the two paths cannot drift. `SqlSchemaHandler` column derivation covers entity_reference (varchar UUID) / json / datetime / date / email. Core entity contracts (entity keys, `_data` blob, save/load lifecycle) are unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-19 - mission sql-entity-query-access-checking-01KRYP15 (#1495): `EntityQueryInterface` gains `setAccount(?AccountInterface): static`. `SqlEntityQuery::execute()` now runs per-row access filtering via `EntityAccessHandler::check($entity, 'view', $account)` and drops `forbidden` rows; `accessCheck(true)` is the default (the v0.1.0 stub was a no-op). Missing-account + check-enabled throws the new `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Exception\MissingQueryAccountException` — fail-closed. `accessCheck(false)` remains as the audited system-context bypass; `SqlEntityStorage::loadByKey()` uses it as a system-context identity primitive. `SqlEntityStorage::getQuery()` wires `withAccessHandler($accessHandler)` (optional 8th constructor param, nullable) and `withEntityLoader(loadMultiple)` so the filter is live end-to-end. Full enforcement-layer description lives in `docs/specs/access-control.md`; entity-system contracts (entity keys, `_data` blob, save/load lifecycle) are unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-13c - issue #1457 fix: pure test-fixture refactor (no spec-level behavioural change). `TranslatableArticleFixture` / `SqlColumnTranslatableArticleFixture` extracted from inside `SqlBlobTranslatableTest.php` / `SqlColumnTranslatableTest.php` to their own PSR-4 files under `packages/entity-storage/tests/Backend/`. The classes were previously not discoverable by composer's PSR-4 autoloader (no matching file path under the `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Tests\` namespace map), so `is_subclass_of($class, TranslatableInterface::class)` in `EntityType::__construct()` returned false when the parent test file had not yet been loaded as a side-effect — causing 17 `ci/unit-tests` errors on `main` after M-006 added cross-test fixture references. Entity-system pipeline, storage layout, and translatable contract are unchanged. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-13b - issue #1449 fix: the prior "long-term" note (widen `EntityRepository::save()` to accept SaveContext) is now shipped. `EntityRepository::save(EntityInterface $entity, bool $validate = true, ?SaveContext $context = null): int` accepts an optional third parameter; default `null` resolves to `SaveContext::default()` and preserves all pre-#1449 behaviour. The repository is now the single dispatch site for `BeforeSaveEvent` / `AfterSaveEvent` on the save path — `EntityDestination::write()` no longer self-dispatches; it threads `SaveContext::asImport()` through `save(...$context: ...)`. `EntityRepositoryInterface::save()` is intentionally left at `(EntityInterface, bool)` because `SaveContext` lives in `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage` (L1) under `Waaseyaa\Entity\Repository` — adding it to the interface would invert the layer graph. `UnitOfWork::bufferEvent()` widened from `Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\Event` to `object` to buffer the lifecycle events (they implement only `EntityLifecycleEventInterface`). Revisionable backends' `setCurrentRevision()` dispatches are unchanged — they fire on the revision-pointer flip API, not the save path. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-13 - M-002 migration-platform-v1 (squash d92f82f): purely additive — `SaveContext` gains `isImport` readonly bool (default false) and `asImport()` factory. No change to existing SaveContext callers; default-false preserves baseline event payloads bit-identical. Used by `Waaseyaa\Migration\Plugin\Destination\EntityDestination` to signal migration writes via dispatched BeforeSave/AfterSave events (mission-internal — not §5.8 stable surface). Long-term: consider widening `EntityRepository::save()` to accept SaveContext so destinations don't need to self-dispatch coordinator events. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-10 - WP05 php-8.5 upgrade: @PHP8x5Migration cs-fixer pass — EntityRepository, SqlEntityStorage, FileStorage touched by octal_notation + new_expression_parentheses rules only; no semantic change to entity pipeline, storage, or lifecycle hooks. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-10 - WP03 php-8.5 upgrade: EntityRepositoryInterface::find/findMany/findBy/loadRevision/rollback gained #[\NoDiscard] — no change to repository semantics, storage pipeline, or entity lifecycle. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-09 - alpha.200/201 framework-hygiene: EntityRepositoryInterface gained the two-axis translation surface (saveTranslation / loadTranslation / listTranslationRevisions), promoted from the concrete EntityRepository — alpha.200 briefly carried all 8 two-axis methods; alpha.201 narrowed the interface to the 3 consumers actually call, the per-revision API (saveTranslationRevision(s)/loadTranslationRevision/loadTranslationTip/translationLangcodes) stays on the concrete. EntityRepository.php also dropped a useless `(int)` cast in listRevisions (getRevisionIds already returns int[]). No change to repository semantics, storage pipeline, or entity lifecycle. The interface code block below is an illustrative subset by design (omits the translation + published-revision surface); two-axis storage is specified in docs/specs/revision-system-unified.md (the live canonical; entity-storage-two-axis.md is the superseded M-004 vid model). -->

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-06-09 - alpha.202 fork fix: TranslatableInterface::language() un-deprecated (removed #[\Deprecated] + the unresolved 'since: 0.next' placeholder). language() and activeLangcode() are distinct, supported accessors — language() returns a `langcode`/'en' fallback for entities without `default_langcode`, activeLangcode() throws. No schema, storage-pipeline, or entity-lifecycle change. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-04 - issue #1376 (deferred WP07-A from mission #1257): EntityTypeManager constructor gained an 8th optional parameter `?\Closure $bundleSubtableExistsProbe = null` with signature `fn(string $entityTypeId, string $bundle): bool`. After a successful `addBundleFields()` registration, when a probe is configured and reports the per-bundle subtable absent, the manager emits a once-per-(entity_type_id, bundle) `[BUNDLE_SUBTABLE_MISSING]` notice via the injected logger. Probe failures are caught and logged at info — registration is never failed over an advisory check. AbstractKernel wires the probe with `$database->schema()->tableExists(SqlSchemaHandler::resolveSubtableName($entityTypeId, $bundle))`. Pre-existing callers (tests, bare bootstraps) that omit the probe stay silent. Companion to the load-side notice that landed in WP06 (SqlEntityStorage::mergeBundleSubtableRow); together they cover both registration-time and runtime detection of missing subtables. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-13 - M-006 entity-storage-translations-v1 (squash 0f7e1809a): substantial additive surface for single-axis translations. EntityRepository gains findTranslations() (single SQL query, NFR-005) and optional ?LanguageManagerInterface + readActiveLanguage flag (C-004). Matching findTranslations() on EntityRepositoryInterface + EntityStorageDriverInterface. SaveContext::withLangcode(string) + langcodeRequired() guard in EntityStorageCoordinator. CoordinatorLifecycleDispatcher dispatches 6 new PRE/POST_TRANSLATION_* events with langcode payload. EntitySchemaSync routes translatable entity types to either widened sql-blob PK or sibling sql-column __translation table via new TranslationSchemaHandler + SqlColumnTranslationHydrator. SqlStorageDriver + InMemoryStorageDriver gain matching translation read/write paths. Non-translatable entity types preserve baseline behavior bit-identical (NFR-001 invariant). Full canonical surface and design rationale: docs/specs/entity-storage-translations-v1.md. M-006 is BETA-GATE per stability-charter §3.2 criterion 9 (now SATISFIED). -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-03b - autoload hygiene: `FieldAttributeRule` (a PHPStan rule that imports `PHPStan\Rules\Rule`) moved out of `packages/entity/src/PhpStan/` into `packages/entity/testing/PhpStan/`, registered under autoload-dev only. `PackageManifestCompiler::scanClasses()` no longer reflectively touches the file in production consumer installs that lack PHPStan, so kernel boot stays clean.

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-03 - issue #1375 fix: SqlStorageDriver now performs the same column-vs-`_data` split that SqlEntityStorage does on the legacy save path. Two new private helpers — splitForWrite() at the start of write() routes values through `$schema->fieldExists()` and packs the rest into a `_data` JSON blob; mergeFromRead() decodes `_data` and re-flattens it onto the row at every read boundary (read, readMultiple, readWithTranslation, readMultipleWithTranslation, findBy). Closes the gap where EntityRepository -> SqlStorageDriver sent raw entity values straight to DBALInsert and crashed any entity whose declarative `#[Field]` attributes lacked dedicated columns (canonical case: User's mail/email_verified/status/created). Locked by tests/Integration/EntityStorage/RepositoryUserRoundTripTest.php. First caught by skeleton-smoke CI (#1315) against a Packagist install of alpha.166. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-02b - mission #1257 WP10 review hardening (PR #1367 review feedback): two security-adjacent guards tightened. (1) `EntityType::fromClass()` now throws `\LogicException` when a cache hit's tenancy slot disagrees with the requested override — silently returning the cached non-tenant instance to a caller asking for community scoping (or the inverse) would disable isolation. The `framework norm: one canonical EntityType per class` cache convention still applies for presentation overrides; tenancy is treated as a security boundary. Tests in `EntityTypeFromClassTest` cover same-tenancy reuse, conflicting override, and removing-tenancy-on-second-call. (2) `AbstractKernel::resolveCommunityScope()` now distinguishes development from production: in `local`/`dev`/`development`/`testing`, missing context still logs a once-per-type warning and falls back to null scope (tests/CLI/bare bootstrap stay green); in production, it throws `[TENANCY_MISCONFIGURED] RuntimeException` to refuse silent disablement of community isolation. WP11 test file split the single missing-context test into a dev-mode and production-mode pair. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-05-02 - mission #1257 WP10 implementation: C1 declarative tenancy on EntityType complete. EntityType ctor accepts a validated `tenancy: ?array` slot (only `['scope' => 'community']` recognized today; future region/org scopes require an explicit code change), exposed via getTenancy() on EntityTypeInterface. EntityTypeManager emits one `[deprecated] HasCommunityInterface` warning per entity-type id when the registered class still carries the legacy marker but the slot is null (memoized; silenced once tenancy: ['scope' => 'community'] is declared). AbstractKernel::resolveCommunityScope() reads getTenancy() and injects CommunityScope into SqlStorageDriver when a CommunityContextInterface is bound (via $kernel->setCommunityContext()); when tenancy is declared but no context is bound, the kernel logs a once-per-type warning and falls back to a null scope rather than crashing boot.

## Packages

| Package | Path | Namespace | Purpose |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| entity | `packages/entity/` | `Waaseyaa\Entity\` | Interfaces, base classes, entity type definitions, events. No storage. |
| entity-storage | `packages/entity-storage/` | `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\` | SQL storage, schema handler, query builder, repository, unit of work. |
| field | `packages/field/` | `Waaseyaa\Field\` | Field type plugins, field definitions, field item lists. |

## Class-level metadata (content entities)

**Identity:** Each concrete `ContentEntityBase` **must** declare `#[ContentEntityType(id: '…')]` (machine name). The constructor throws `EntityMetadataException` if the type id is still empty after resolution. Explicit `$entityTypeId` / non-empty `$entityKeys` in `__construct` remain supported for tests and `fromStorage`.

**Key map:** `#[ContentEntityKeys(…)]` is optional. Logical keys supported: `id`, `uuid`, `label`, `bundle`, `revision`, `langcode` — each parameter is a storage field name; omitted/`null` means “not overridden in this attribute pass.” After merging attributes along the class hierarchy, **identity defaults** apply for any of `id` / `uuid` / `label` still missing (`id`→`id`, `uuid`→`uuid`, `label`→`label`). `EntityMetadataReader::forClass()` returns the resolved key map; results are **cached per class-string** for the process.

**Fields:** Class attributes describe **only** entity type id and the logical→storage key map. They do **not** define field lists; `fieldDefinitions` on `EntityType`, the field registry, and YAML/config remain the source of field shape.

**Registration parity:** `EntityTypeManager` validates that, for any registered type whose `getClass()` is a `ContentEntityBase` subclass, `EntityType::id()` matches `#[ContentEntityType]`, and `EntityType::getKeys()` (sorted) exactly matches `EntityMetadataReader::forClass($class)->keys` (sorted). Mismatch throws `InvalidArgumentException` at registration time.

**SSR:** `ContentEntityTypeReader` delegates to `EntityMetadataReader` and resolves the type id from the class or its parents (see app-controller spec).

## Casting & hydration architecture (ST-9, #1181)

This section is the canonical contract for **storage-shaped values** vs **domain-shaped values**, where each applies, and how presentation layers stay consistent. Deeper package references: `packages/entity/src/Cast/`, `packages/entity/src/EntityBase.php`, `packages/entity/src/EntityValues.php`, `packages/entity-storage/src/Hydration/EntityInstantiator.php`. Casting and hydration boundary details: **#1181**; **backed enums and value-object (`FromArrayEntityValueInterface`) casts: #1184**.

### Hydration pipeline (row → instance)

No casting runs at the storage boundary. Rows are merged into a single PHP array (`_data` decoded, numeric id normalized), then the entity is constructed.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[SQL row + _data JSON] --> B[mapRowToEntity / EntityRepository::hydrate]
  B --> C["values bag (storage-canonical)"]
  C --> D{Class implements HydratableFromStorageInterface?}
  D -->|yes| E["fromStorage(values, HydrationContext)"]
  D -->|no| F["legacy reflection ctor (values ± entityTypeId/keys)"]
  E --> G[Entity instance]
  F --> G
  G --> H["get() applies castIn only when field in $casts"]
```

### Read vs write within an entity

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph persistence["Persistence snapshot"]
    V[values array] --> TA[toArray]
    TA --> W[splitForStorage / driver write]
  end
  subgraph domain["Domain access"]
    G[get] --> CI[ValueCaster::castIn]
    SO[set] --> CO[ValueCaster::castOut]
    CO --> V
  end
  CI --> DV[Domain type in PHP]
```

### Storage vs domain value (examples)

| Field kind | Stored in `$values` / `toArray()` | Returned by `get()` when `$casts` set | Notes |
|------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------|
| Backed enum | Backing scalar (`string`/`int`) | Enum instance | `set()` accepts instance or backing value; `castOut` persists scalar. **Invalid backing / unknown case:** `get()` throws `CastException` (no silent null). |
| Value object (`FromArrayEntityValueInterface`) | **Same as `array` cast:** JSON string in `$values` after `set()` | VO instance | **Storage invariant (#1184):** identical pipeline to `array` — `EntityCastCoercion::castInArray` / `castOutArray` so there is no alternate encoding or schema drift. Hydrate may supply a PHP `array` or JSON string; `get()` returns the VO. **`set()`:** MUST accept a VO instance of the cast class; MAY accept an `array` (via `fromArray` then `toArray` → storage); MUST NOT accept arbitrary scalars. **Immutability:** the framework does not enforce readonly VOs; implementations **SHOULD** be immutable for predictable cast behavior. Cast spec: backed enum class-string **or** VO class-string implementing `FromArrayEntityValueInterface`, or `['type' => 'value_object', 'class' => ClassName::class]`. **Wrong class:** stable error *Value object cast requires class implementing FromArrayEntityValueInterface*. |
| `datetime_immutable` | ISO string, Unix int, or string digits | `DateTimeImmutable` | `castOut` → ISO-8601 `ATOM` |
| `array` / `json` | JSON string | `array` | `castOut` re-encodes with `JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR` |
| Definition-classified `boolean` / `bool` | Native PHP `bool` (`null` when nullable) | Same native PHP `bool` | Definition-driven at seal/write; legacy backend `0`/`1` is decoded before the entity is observable |
| `$casts` `int` / `float` / `bool` / `string` | Normalized scalar | Same PHP scalar (validated) | Empty string → error for numeric casts per `ValueCaster` rules |
| No `$casts` entry | Any | Same as stored | Pass-through |

### Invariants

1. **Constructor / hydration:** the resolved definition layout canonicalizes every present, non-null `boolean`/`bool` field to native PHP `bool` while the private value container is atomically sealed. Other values are not passed through `ValueCaster`; they must already be storage-safe.
2. **`toArray()`:** Returns the internal `$values` array **without** `castIn`; callers MUST NOT treat it as domain-typed if the entity uses `$casts`.
3. **`get($name)`:** If `$casts[$name]` exists, return `castIn($name, $raw, $spec)`; otherwise return raw (or `null` if key missing).
4. **`set($name, $value)`:** If `$casts[$name]` exists, first store `castOut(...)`; the sealed container then canonicalizes a definition-classified boolean field to native PHP `bool`. Other uncast values pass through. After `set()`, persistence snapshots remain JSON- and SQL-driver-safe.
5. **Save path:** `EntityRepository::doSave()` extracts the already-canonical sealed values. Every base, bundle, revision, translation, rollback, and backfill snapshot carries native PHP `bool` for boolean-classified fields; adapters own any physical database encoding.
6. **Load path:** `EntityInstantiator` does not invoke subclass `$casts`; the definition layout canonicalizes boolean-classified values during atomic sealed hydration, while other casting remains lazy on `get()` / presentation helpers.
7. **Tests:** Override `protected function valueCaster(): ValueCaster` on an entity subclass to inject fakes; default is `new ValueCaster()`.

### Rules for `EntityValues`

File: `packages/entity/src/EntityValues.php`

- **`toCastAwareMap(EntityInterface $entity): array`** — For each key in `array_keys($entity->toArray())`, set `$map[$key] = $entity->get($key)`. Same keys as the persistence bag, values as domain types where casts apply. Use for GraphQL, SSR field bags, MCP payloads, discovery visibility, workflow validation listeners, relationship traversal summaries, and any code that previously iterated `toArray()` expecting “real” types.
- **`toJsonReadyMap(EntityInterface $entity): array`** — `toCastAwareMap()` plus recursive JSON normalization (backed enums → scalar, `DateTimeInterface` → ISO-8601 ATOM, `JsonSerializable`, **`FromArrayEntityValueInterface` → `toArray()` then same recursion as nested arrays** — including nested VOs inside arrays, #1184). Use for embedding text construction, MCP/logging payloads, and anywhere `json_encode` must not receive raw storage scalars when casts exist. `ResourceSerializer` delegates attribute normalization to **`normalizeValueForJson(mixed $value): mixed`** (same implementation) so JSON:API and other sinks stay aligned (#1181 ST-10).
- **`statusToInt(mixed $status): int`** — Normalizes bool/int/string/`BackedEnum` to `0|1` for strict published checks; use with `$entity->get('status')` or values taken from a cast-aware map.
- **Do not use** `EntityValues` for: persistence, `SqlEntityStorage`, repository `save()`, or low-level drivers.

### Layering rules (ST-10, #1181)

| Concern | Allowed reads | Forbidden for domain semantics |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Persistence (`entity-storage`, `EntityRepository`) | `toArray()` for save / `splitForStorage` | Calling `ValueCaster` or `EntityValues` inside drivers — hydration stays raw at the row boundary |
| Presentation (JSON:API, GraphQL, SSR, MCP, discovery, `ai-*` pipelines, workflow listeners, relationship) | `get($field)`, `EntityValues::toCastAwareMap()`, `EntityValues::toJsonReadyMap()` | `toArray()` for attribute/visibility/embedding text when the entity defines `$casts` |
| Workflow visibility | `WorkflowVisibility::isNodePublicForEntity(EntityInterface)` or an array already built with `toCastAwareMap` | `isNodePublic($entity->toArray())` for nodes with enum/bool `status` casts |

**Circular dependencies:** Package `composer.json` `require` must respect the Layer Architecture table in root `CLAUDE.md` (lower layers never depend on higher layers). `waaseyaa/entity` must not require `waaseyaa/api`; shared JSON shaping lives on `EntityValues` in `entity`.

### Rules for `get()` / `set()`

- **`get()`** — The only supported way to read cast fields as domain objects (enums, `DateTimeImmutable`, decoded arrays, **VOs implementing `FromArrayEntityValueInterface`**) without duplicating cast logic.
- **`set()`** — Accepts domain input for cast fields; always persists storage shape into `$values`. For **value-object** casts, see the table above (instance required; array optional; scalars rejected, #1184).

### Admin JSON Schema vs `$casts`

`SchemaPresenter` (`packages/api/src/Schema/SchemaPresenter.php`) builds widgets from **EntityType field definitions**, not from entity class `$casts`. A VO field may still serialize correctly over JSON:API via `EntityValues` when `$casts` is set on the entity class; **admin form schema** for structured VOs may require explicit field definition work (e.g. object / JSON widget) in a follow-up — not inferred automatically from `$casts` (#1184).
- Direct mutation of `$values` from outside the entity class is unsupported; subclasses that override `get`/`set` must preserve cast semantics or document exceptions.

### Rules for `toArray()`

- **Purpose:** Persistence and structural cloning of the storage bag.
- **Anti-pattern:** Building user-facing or API attributes solely from `toArray()` when `$casts` is non-empty — use `get()` per field or `EntityValues::toCastAwareMap()`.
- **OK uses:** `SqlEntityStorage::splitForStorage()`, export pipelines that intentionally emit raw YAML/JSON matching the DB, tests asserting stored scalars.

### Typed config entities (`ConfigEntityBase`)

`ConfigEntityBase` extends `EntityBase`, so **`$casts` applies to keys in the values bag** the same as content entities.

Additional rules specific to config:

- **`status` / `dependencies`:** The constructor copies `status` and `dependencies` from `$values` into protected properties **and** leaves them in `$values` for the parent bag. `enable()` / `disable()` / `setDependencies()` keep the object and `$values` in sync for persistence.
- **`toConfig()`:** Starts from `toArray()` (raw), then overwrites `status` with the object’s `status()` and injects `dependencies` when non-empty — export remains stable even if only the typed properties were mutated.
- **`get('status')`:** If `status` is listed in `$casts` (e.g. `bool`), `get()` returns the cast domain value; `status()` still reflects the boolean property (they should agree after `enable()`/`disable()`/`set()`).
- **JSON:API:** Config entities use string machine name as resource id when UUID is empty; attribute building still goes through cast-aware reads (`ResourceSerializer` → `EntityValues::toCastAwareMap()`).

### Worked example (content entity)

```php
// $casts includes 'published_at' => 'datetime_immutable'
$entity = $storage->load(1); // row has published_at as ISO string in _data
$entity->get('published_at'); // DateTimeImmutable
$entity->toArray()['published_at']; // still string (storage shape)

$entity->set('published_at', new DateTimeImmutable('2026-04-09T12:00:00+00:00'));
$storage->save($entity); // toArray() carries ISO string suitable for _data
```

### Query-builder boundary (K3, mission #1257)

`SqlEntityQuery::execute()` extends ST-9 to the read path. SQLite's `json_extract(...)` returns the native JSON type (integer for `13`, string for `"13"`) and SQLite has no column affinity for expression results, so a strict-typed comparison silently drops rows when the bound parameter type does not match the JSON type. K3 closes this with two coordinated mechanisms, both consulting the same `FieldDefinition::getType()` source-of-truth as ST-9:

1. **Numeric-string parameter coercion (the `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `BETWEEN` path).** `coerceConditionValue()` looks up the registered `FieldDefinition` for the referenced field (core or bundle, via `lookupFieldDefinition()`) and casts numeric-string values to the declared PHP type — `'13'` → `13` for `integer`, `'1.5'` → `1.5` for `float`/`decimal`/`numeric`. The binder then sees an int/float and the comparison commutes. Non-numeric types (`string`, `text`, `uri`, `entity_reference`) and non-numeric-string values pass through unchanged. Boolean coercion is intentionally omitted (PHP/SQL boolean conventions diverge — `'true'`, `'1'`, `'on'`).

2. **Text-cast wrapping for `IN` against `json_extract` fields.** The underlying DBAL helper hardcodes `ArrayParameterType::STRING` for `IN`-set parameters, so PHP-side coercion alone cannot fix `IN` comparisons. When the resolved field is a `json_extract(...)` expression, `SqlEntityQuery::execute()` wraps it in `CAST(... AS TEXT)` and stringifies every IN-set value, forcing text-vs-text equality. Detection uses the `ResolvedField::isJsonExtract()` shape (WP6 #1816 — formerly the now-removed `expressionResolvesViaJsonExtract()` string scan) so the wrapping covers both K2 (`FieldStorage::Data` hint) and the column-absent fallback path. Since WP6 the wrapped expression is emitted through `SelectInterface::whereRaw('CAST(... AS TEXT) IN (?)', [$values])` (verbatim, array param expanded) rather than `condition()` — `condition()` now auto-quotes its `$field` and would corrupt the expression. Numeric ordering is preserved on `<` / `>` (those use mechanism 1, not the cast wrapping).

`CONTAINS`, `STARTS_WITH`, `LIKE`, `IS NULL`, and `IS NOT NULL` skip coercion: they are explicit string-pattern or null-check operators where coercion would surprise callers.

Reproduction case (#1257 anchor): integer `_data` field compared to a string literal. Pre-K3, the SQLite path returned an empty set silently. Post-K3, both single-value (`condition('user_id', '13')`) and IN-set (`condition('user_id', ['1', 13], 'IN')`) commute against the declared cast.

## Core Interfaces (packages/entity/src/)

### EntityInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/EntityInterface.php`

    public function set(string $name, mixed $value): static;
    public function getFieldDefinitions(): array; // array<string, mixed>
}

### Field value casting (kernel)

**Diagrams, full invariant list, `EntityValues` / `get` / `set` / `toArray` / config rules:** see [Casting & hydration architecture (ST-9, #1181)](#casting--hydration-architecture-st-9-1181).

Files: `packages/entity/src/Cast/`

`CastDefinition` is a small readonly value object wrapping a cast spec: either a **string token** (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `array`, `datetime_immutable`, or a **backed enum** class-string) or an array escape hatch `['type' => 'json']` (equivalent to `array` — JSON in storage).

`ValueCaster` performs **storage → domain** (`castIn`) and **domain → storage** (`castOut`) for those specs. For **`int`**, **`float`**, **`bool`**, **`string`**, and **`array`** / **`json`**, the implementation delegates to **`Waaseyaa\TypedData\Coercion\EntityCastCoercion`** in `waaseyaa/typed-data` (#1185); **`CoercionException`** is wrapped as **`CastException`** so callers see one exception type.

P0 built-ins:

| Spec | `castIn` (stored → domain) | `castOut` (domain → stored) |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| `int` / `float` / `bool` / `string` | Normalization with documented rejection rules (e.g. empty string → error for numeric casts) via `EntityCastCoercion` | Canonical scalars via `EntityCastCoercion` |
| `array` | JSON string decoded with `JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR`, or pass-through when already an array | `json_encode` with `JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR` |
| `datetime_immutable` | `DateTimeImmutable` (or `Carbon\CarbonImmutable` when `domain` is `carbon_immutable` and Carbon is installed); storage accepts ISO-8601 strings, integer / all-digit string Unix timestamps, `DateTimeInterface` | Default storage: ISO-8601 `ATOM`. Array spec `['type' => 'datetime_immutable', 'storage' => 'unix']` persists UTC Unix integers; `['type' => 'datetime_immutable', 'domain' => 'carbon_immutable']` maps domain to Carbon (optional `nesbot/carbon`) (#1183) |
| Backed enum class-string | `tryFrom` on backing value; miss → `CastException` | Enum instance or backing value → `->value` |

Non-backed enums and unknown class-strings (non-enum classes) are rejected (`CastException`). Value-object class casts are reserved for #1184.

**Null tolerance (#1940, G-028):** `castIn(null, ...)` / `castOut(null, ...)` both return `null` unconditionally for every built-in spec, checked before any per-type dispatch — this is the general rule, not specific to `datetime_immutable`. For `datetime_immutable` the null-safety is additionally enforced one layer deeper, inside the private `castOutDateTimeImmutable()` helper itself, so a `null` domain value stays a no-throw no-op even if a future caller reaches that helper without going through `castOut()`'s top-level guard first. This matters for `unix`-storage casts such as Node's `created` / `changed` (`['type' => 'datetime_immutable', 'storage' => 'unix']`): WordPress corpora (Sheguiandah pass-1) commonly have records with no modified date, and prior to this the consuming site had to default the value itself before calling `set()`.

**Storage invariant (#1181, #2064):** entity internal values and persistence
snapshots remain canonical. A resolved `boolean`/`bool` field is always native
PHP `bool` (or nullable `null`) regardless of whether a subclass declares a
cast; this definition-level rule takes precedence over legacy backend `0`/`1`
shapes. Other subclass `$casts` retain their `ValueCaster` behavior.

**Interaction with hydration (#1188, #2064):** backend rows remain opaque to
entity subclasses. The atomic initialization boundary resolves the field
definitions and canonicalizes boolean-classified values before sealing; no
consumer can observe the backend's physical boolean representation.

**Persistence (ST-4 / ST-5, #1181):**

- Repository hydration seals backend rows through the definition layout; boolean-classified `0`/`1` values become native PHP `bool` before validation or ordinary reads.
- `EntityRepository::doSave()` extracts one already-canonical snapshot shared by base, bundle, and revision writes. Boolean-classified fields remain native PHP `bool`; SQL adapters/schema mappings own physical database encoding.
- After `set()` on any other cast field, `castOut` keeps scalars / JSON strings (e.g. backed enum value, `array` → JSON string) so the driver does not see live objects in the blob.

Integration coverage: `packages/entity-storage/tests/Unit/CastPersistenceIntegrationTest.php` (in-memory `EntityRepository` + SQLite `SqlEntityStorage`).

**JSON:API serialization (ST-7, #1181):** `Waaseyaa\Api\ResourceSerializer` builds attributes from `EntityValues::toCastAwareMap($entity)` (same keys as `toArray()`, values from `get()`), excluding `id`/`uuid` storage keys, then applies field-definition boolean/timestamp coercions and JSON normalization (enums, `DateTimeInterface`, nested arrays). See `docs/specs/jsonapi.md`. Do not build attributes from `toArray()` alone — that bypasses `$casts`.

**Presentation map (ST-8, #1181):** `Waaseyaa\Entity\EntityValues::toCastAwareMap()` returns all keys from `toArray()` with values from `get()` — use this (or `get()` per field) in GraphQL resolvers, discovery visibility, relationship policies, SSR field bags, MCP tool payloads, embedding text extraction, and workflow visibility helpers. Definition-classified boolean values are already native PHP `bool`; presentation code must not reintroduce a `0`/`1` observable. `EntityValues::statusToInt()` remains a compatibility helper for genuinely boolean-like legacy/non-field inputs, not the canonical entity-field read contract.

### Branching and snapshots (P3)

Files: `packages/entity/src/EntityBase.php`, `packages/entity/src/ContentEntityBase.php`, `packages/entity/src/Snapshot/EntityValuesSnapshot.php`

**Public API:** `EntityBase::duplicate()`, `with()`, `withValues()`; readonly `EntityValuesSnapshot`. **Extension hook:** `protected function duplicateInstance(array $values): static` (not listed as public semver surface in `docs/public-surface-map.php`).

**Constructor re-entry:** `duplicate()` builds a shallow copy of the internal value bag and reconstructs the instance via `duplicateInstance()`, which must call `new $class(...)` so subclass / `ConfigEntityBase` / `ContentEntityBase` constructors run (status, dependencies, `fieldDefinitions`, etc.). Subclasses with exotic constructors may override `duplicate()` or `duplicateInstance()` explicitly; that is not the default.

**Subclass constructor arity:** `ContentEntityBase::duplicateInstance()` calls `new static($values, $entityTypeId, $entityKeys, $fieldDefinitions)`. `ConfigEntityBase` inherits `EntityBase::duplicateInstance()`, which passes `($values, $entityTypeId, $entityKeys)`. A subclass that declares only `__construct(array $values = [])` will receive **too many arguments** under PHP 8+, and `duplicate()` / `with()` / `withValues()` will throw `ArgumentCountError`. Remedies: (1) **widen** `__construct` with optional `$entityTypeId`, `$entityKeys`, and (for content) `$fieldDefinitions`, defaulting to the type’s canonical id/keys and forwarding to `parent::__construct`; (2) **override** `duplicateInstance()` to reconstruct safely (e.g. `HydratableFromStorageInterface::fromStorage()` for types that implement it, plus any extra state such as `fieldDefinitions` not carried in `HydrationContext`). Regression coverage: `tests/Integration/ShippedEntityDuplicateReentryTest.php`.

**Scaffold / greenfield content entities:** Prefer `HydratableFromStorageInterface` + `public static function fromStorage(array $values, HydrationContext $context): static` for storage hydration (`EntityInstantiator`), optional `public static function make(array $values): self` for tests, `$casts` for domain-shaped fields, and `get()`/`set()` in accessors (not raw `$this->values[…]`). Framework references: `packages/user/src/User.php`, `packages/node/src/Node.php`. CLI: `make:entity-type --content` emits a widening constructor stub and interface imports — adjust the machine name and keys to match your `EntityType` registration.

**Shallow-copy invariant:** `duplicate()` copies top-level keys only; nested arrays / JSON-shaped structures are **not** deep-cloned and remain **reference-shared** with the source entity’s bag. Deep clone is **out of scope** for P3 and needs a dedicated design (blobs, relationship metadata, performance).

**Identity:** Duplicates preserve `id`, `uuid`, and other keys in the copied bag, and preserve `enforceIsNew` from the source. `duplicate()` does not mean “blank new row” unless the source already represented that state.

**`with()` / `withValues()`:** `duplicate()` then `set()` per field. They throw the **same** exceptions as `set()` (e.g. `CastException`). When P2 enum / value-object field types land (#1184 / #1185), `with()` must accept the same domain-shaped values as `set()` and rely on `castOut` — no second error model.

**Readonly snapshot vs fork vs live entity:**

- `EntityValuesSnapshot` — storage-canonical bag at a point in time; `get()` / `has()` / `toStorageArray()` are not cast-aware. Optional **injected** cast map enables `getCastAware()` via `ValueCaster` for keys in that map only. No mutation and no rehydration helpers on the snapshot type; build a live entity via `EntityInstantiator` or entity constructors when needed.
- `duplicate()` — mutable fork sharing nested references per the shallow invariant.
- Live entity — ordinary `get()` / `set()` / `toArray()` semantics (#1181).

**Events:** `EntityRepository::doSave()` continues to pass PRE_SAVE / POST_SAVE `originalEntity` from `find($id)` (DB truth), not an in-memory `duplicate()` of the working copy. Regression coverage: `EntityRepositoryTest::preSaveOriginalEntityReflectsStoredRowNotInMemoryDuplicate`.

### ContentEntityInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/ContentEntityInterface.php`

Extends `EntityInterface` and `FieldableInterface`. No additional methods.

### ConfigEntityInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/ConfigEntityInterface.php`

```php
interface ConfigEntityInterface extends EntityInterface
{
    public function status(): bool;
    public function enable(): static;
    public function disable(): static;
    public function getDependencies(): array; // array<string, string[]>
    public function toConfig(): array;
}
```

### EntityTypeInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/EntityTypeInterface.php`

```php
interface EntityTypeInterface
{
    public function id(): string;
    public function getLabel(): string;
    public function getClass(): string;                     // class-string<EntityInterface>
    public function getStorageClass(): string;              // class-string<EntityStorageInterface>
    public function getKeys(): array;                       // array<string, string>
    public function isRevisionable(): bool;
    public function getRevisionDefault(): bool;
    public function isTranslatable(): bool;
    public function getBundleEntityType(): ?string;
    public function getConstraints(): array;                // array<string, mixed>
    public function getFieldDefinitions(): array;           // array<string, array<string, mixed>>
    public function getGroup(): ?string;                    // admin sidebar group key
    public function getDescription(): ?string;              // human-readable description
}
```

`EntityType` additionally carries `discoverable: bool = true` (+ `isDiscoverable()` accessor; `EntityTypeInterface` deliberately not widened — read duck-typed) — visibility in the `GET /api` discovery index only (see api-layer.md, mission request-surface-hardening-01KTX7F2, #1649); not an access control.

### EntityTypeManagerInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/EntityTypeManagerInterface.php`

```php
interface EntityTypeManagerInterface
{
    public function getDefinition(string $entityTypeId): EntityTypeInterface;
    public function registerEntityType(EntityTypeInterface $type, ?string $registrant = null): void;
    public function registerCoreEntityType(EntityTypeInterface $type, ?string $registrant = null): void;
    public function getDefinitions(): array;        // array<string, EntityTypeInterface>
    public function hasDefinition(string $entityTypeId): bool;
    public function getStorage(string $entityTypeId): EntityStorageInterface;
    public function getRepository(string $entityTypeId): EntityRepositoryInterface;
}
```

`getRepository()` returns `EntityRepositoryInterface` (`EntityRepository` in practice) — the **sole persistence engine**, with hydration, lifecycle events, revisions, optimistic locking, save-time validation, two-axis translation, language fallback, `saveMany()`/`UnitOfWork`, and an access-checked `getQuery()`. The kernel registers a repository factory so consumers can wrap `EntityTypeManager::getRepository($entityTypeId)` in thin domain repositories without manually assembling `SqlStorageDriver`, `RevisionableStorageDriver`, and `EntityRepository` dependencies.

`getStorage()` returns `EntityStorageInterface` — a **generic, unwired extension seam**, not a first-party persistence path. See "The legacy save engine is gone (C-22)" below.

#### The legacy save engine is gone (C-22)

The framework used to expose **two entry points that both persisted entities in production** — `getRepository()` (`EntityRepository`, canonical) and `getStorage()` (`SqlEntityStorage`, legacy). C-22 removed the legacy engine across four work packages:

- **WP0–WP2**: gave `EntityRepository` an access-checked `getQuery()` and migrated every `getStorage()->getQuery()` consumer onto it.
- **WP3**: migrated every remaining `getStorage()`-based `load()`/`loadMultiple()`/`create()`/`save()`/`delete()`/`loadByKey()` callsite onto the equivalent `getRepository()` method, added `EntityRepositoryInterface::create()`, and confirmed via the dead-code gate that `SqlEntityStorage`'s core methods had zero production callers left.
- **WP4**: **deleted `SqlEntityStorage.php` and `EntityStorageFactory.php` outright.** `EntityRepository` is now the only class in the framework that persists entities. `EntityStorageInterface` (and the shared `SqlEntityQuery`/`BundleSubtableGateway`/`SqlStorageDriver`/`EntityInstantiator` machinery `EntityRepository` builds on) remain — they were never `SqlEntityStorage`-only — but `SqlEntityStorage` itself, and the kernel's storage-factory closure that built it at every boot, are gone.

**`getStorage()`/`EntityStorageInterface` after WP4 — a dormant "bring your own engine" seam, not a supported path.** `EntityTypeManager::getStorage()` and `EntityTypeManagerInterface::getStorage()` are **kept** (removing them would break `EntityStorageInterface`'s other users — `RevisionableStorageInterface extends EntityStorageInterface` is dormant public API, and several test doubles implement it directly). But the kernel no longer supplies a `storageFactory` closure, and `EntityType::fromClass()`'s `$storageClass` default is now `''` (previously `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\SqlEntityStorage`). Calling `getStorage($entityTypeId)` on any first-party entity type now throws `RuntimeException` ("No storage class configured…") unless the caller supplies their own `EntityStorageInterface` implementation via `$storageClass` or a custom `EntityTypeManager` `storageFactory`. This is intentional: `getStorage()` is no longer a supported persistence path for first-party code, only a residual extension point for a downstream consumer who genuinely wants their own storage engine alongside the canonical repository.

**Canonical path for all code: `EntityRepository` (`getRepository()`)** — mandated by `.claude/rules/entity-storage-invariant.md`, and now the only path the framework itself wires up. There is **no** `StorageRepositoryAdapter` — earlier rule files named one; C-22 made it moot by deleting the second engine instead of adapting one to the other.

`registerEntityType()` and `registerCoreEntityType()` accept an optional registrant class so the registry can emit provenance-aware collision errors. When an entity type id is registered twice with the same class, the manager throws `EntityTypeRegistrationCollisionException` with the duplicate-registration message contract. When the same id is registered with a different class, the manager throws the shadow-collision variant naming the canonical and conflicting classes.

**Reserved-namespace contract (mission #824 WP04 surface A).** The `core.` prefix is reserved for built-in platform entity types. The two registration methods enforce this asymmetrically:

| Method | `core.*` id | Caller |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `registerEntityType()` | rejected — throws `\DomainException` with the `[NAMESPACE_RESERVED]` diagnostic prefix and a remediation hint to use a custom namespace prefix | extensions, tenants, third-party providers |
| `registerCoreEntityType()` | accepted — bypasses the namespace guard | kernel boot code and core service providers only |

Both methods share the same `persistDefinition()` path beyond the namespace check, so collision-provenance and bundle-subtable diagnostics below apply to both. The namespace check is the single behavioural difference between the two methods — there is no other privilege escalation. Calling `registerCoreEntityType()` from extension code is a layer-discipline violation (DIR-006) but is not enforced at runtime; the convention is enforced by code review and by the fact that core registrations live exclusively in `FoundationServiceProvider` and a small named set of layer-0 providers.

**Duplicate registration (K7, mission #1257).** `EntityTypeRegistrationCollisionException::duplicate(...)` names **both** registrants — the existing one (FQCN of class + provenance) and the incoming one — so the operator can reach both call sites from one exception body. Convention only; no contract change.

**Bundle-id structural guard (K1, mission #1257).** `EntityTypeManager::addBundleFields($entityTypeId, $bundleId, $fieldDefinitions)` rejects bundle ids containing `__` at registration time. The double-underscore is reserved for the `{base}__{bundle}` subtable naming; structural validation here prevents downstream collisions in `SqlSchemaHandler` / `SqlEntityStorage` / `SqlEntityQuery`.

**Bundle-subtable absence notice (K4, mission #1257).** When the storage layer encounters a registered `(entity_type, bundle)` whose subtable is not yet materialized, it emits `LoggerInterface::notice()` with diagnostic code `MISSING_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` once per `(entity_type, bundle)` per surface and continues — registration is pre-materialization and runtime DDL is forbidden. Three independent emit sites cover the operator-visible surfaces:

1. **Save path** (`SqlEntityStorage::save()`, mission #1257 pre-WP02): notice fires when bundle-scoped values are present but the subtable is absent at write time.
2. **Load path** (`SqlEntityStorage::mergeBundleSubtableRow()` + `mergeBundleSubtableRowsBatch()`, mission #1257 WP06): notice fires when a row's bundle has registered fields but no subtable. Memoized in `$missingBundleSubtableLoadLogged` independently of the save-time cache so the two surfaces have separate cadences.
3. **Registration path** (`EntityTypeManager::addBundleFields()`): the K4 part A notice is **deferred to a follow-up PR** (mission #1257 WP07-A). Adding the check requires injecting `LoggerInterface` and a schema accessor into `EntityTypeManager::__construct()`, which ripples through the kernel bootstrap and many call sites. The save and load notices above cover the operator-visible signal until WP07-A lands.

See [`bundle-scoped-storage.md`](./bundle-scoped-storage.md) §Lifecycle.

### EntityStorageInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/Storage/EntityStorageInterface.php`

```php
interface EntityStorageInterface
{
    public function create(array $values = []): EntityInterface;
    public function load(int|string $id): ?EntityInterface;
    public function loadByKey(string $key, mixed $value): ?EntityInterface;
    public function loadMultiple(array $ids = []): array;   // array<int|string, EntityInterface>
    public function save(EntityInterface $entity): int;     // SAVED_NEW (1) or SAVED_UPDATED (2)
    public function delete(array $entities): void;          // EntityInterface[]
    public function getQuery(): EntityQueryInterface;
    public function getEntityTypeId(): string;
}
```

`loadByKey()` is a convenience method encapsulating the common query+load pattern: query by an arbitrary unique key, limit to 1, load the result. Equivalent to `$ids = $storage->getQuery()->condition($key, $value)->range(0, 1)->execute(); return $ids ? $storage->load(reset($ids)) : null;`

### EntityQueryInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/Storage/EntityQueryInterface.php`

```php
interface EntityQueryInterface
{
    public function condition(string $field, mixed $value, string $operator = '='): static;
    public function exists(string $field): static;
    public function notExists(string $field): static;
    public function sort(string $field, string $direction = 'ASC'): static;
    public function range(int $offset, int $limit): static;
    public function count(): static;
    public function accessCheck(bool $check = true): static;
    public function execute(): array;  // array<int|string>
}
```

### RevisionableStorageInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/Storage/RevisionableStorageInterface.php`

Extends `EntityStorageInterface`. Adds:

```php
public function loadRevision(int|string $entityId, int $revisionId): ?EntityInterface;

/** @return array<int, EntityInterface> */
public function loadMultipleRevisions(int|string $entityId, array $revisionIds): array;

public function deleteRevision(int|string $entityId, int $revisionId): void;

public function getLatestRevisionId(int|string $entityId): ?int;

/** @return int[] Revision IDs in ascending order. */
public function getRevisionIds(int|string $entityId): array;
```

Every revision operation is scoped by `$entityId` first — revision IDs are unique only within a given entity. Revision IDs are typed `int` (auto-increment); the entity ID stays `int|string` to match the parent `EntityStorageInterface`. Spec ↔ source parity is enforced by `packages/entity/tests/Contract/RevisionableStorageInterfaceContractTest.php` (mission #824 WP04 surface B).

### EntityRepositoryInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/Repository/EntityRepositoryInterface.php`

Higher-level API with language fallback:

```php
interface EntityRepositoryInterface
{
    public function find(string $id, ?string $langcode = null, bool $fallback = false): ?EntityInterface;
    public function findMany(array $ids, ?string $langcode = null, bool $fallback = false): array;
    public function findBy(array $criteria, ?array $orderBy = null, ?int $limit = null): array;
    public function getQuery(): EntityQueryInterface;   // C-22: same access-checked surface as EntityStorageInterface::getQuery()
    public function save(EntityInterface $entity, bool $validate = true): int;
    public function delete(EntityInterface $entity): void;
    public function exists(string $id): bool;
    public function count(array $criteria = []): int;
    public function loadRevision(string $entityId, int $revisionId): ?EntityInterface;
    public function rollback(string $entityId, int $targetRevisionId): EntityInterface;
    public function saveMany(array $entities, bool $validate = true): array;   // int[] (SAVED_NEW/SAVED_UPDATED)
    public function deleteMany(array $entities): int;
}
```

`save()` accepts `bool $validate = true`. When true and an `EntityValidator` is configured, validates against the merged map from `EntityTypeValidationConstraints::forEntityType()` (field definitions + `getConstraints()`, see “Field definitions → constraints” below) before persisting. Throws `EntityValidationException` on failure. **Since alpha.204 (#1643) a validator is configured by default**: the kernel wires one shared `EntityValidator::createDefault()` into every repository it builds, so validation runs framework-wide unless opted out (boot-time `WAASEYAA_ENTITY_VALIDATION=0|false|off`, or per-call `validate: false`).

`saveMany()`/`deleteMany()` wrap all operations in a `UnitOfWork` transaction. Requires `$database` to be non-null (throws `\LogicException` otherwise).

**Event dispatch semantics under `UnitOfWork` (changed 2026-07-02, audit-remediation WP2 review):** the save path splits PRE-write from POST-write dispatch.

- **PRE-write events dispatch IMMEDIATELY, inside the batch transaction** — `EntityEvents::PRE_SAVE` and `BeforeSaveEvent` fire before each entity's row is written, exactly as they do for a single `save()`. Rationale: a PRE event announces *intent*; listeners that mutate the entity (classification label resolution writes resolved columns via `$entity->set()`) or issue guarding DB writes (the attachment at-most-one-active sibling demote) only work if they run before the write — under the old buffer-everything model those mutations happened *after* the batch had committed, so they were silently never persisted, and two attachment-style guards in one batch cross-demoted each other post-commit. The "listeners never observe rolled-back work" goal that buffering exists for is still satisfied: an immediate PRE listener's DB writes JOIN the batch transaction and roll back with it. This also makes `BeforeSaveEvent`'s documented abort contract real inside batches: an `AbortOperationException` thrown for entity *k* of a batch aborts the `UnitOfWork` transaction and rolls back the WHOLE batch (no partial writes) — previously the buffered "abort" fired after every row had already committed. Pinned by `EntityRepositoryTest::saveManyDispatchesPreWriteEventsBeforeRowsAreWritten` / `::saveManyAbortFromBeforeSaveOnSecondEntityRollsBackWholeBatch`.
- **POST/AFTER events remain buffered** — `POST_SAVE`, `REVISION_CREATED`, `AfterSaveEvent` are buffered by the `UnitOfWork` and dispatched only after successful commit (discarded on rollback), unchanged.
- **The delete path is deliberately NOT aligned** — `doDelete()` still buffers `PRE_DELETE` under `deleteMany()`, so batch deletes bypass pre-delete guards (e.g. `RelationshipDeleteGuardListener`, documented as single-delete-only in #1852). Aligning it is a flagged follow-up (see the `dispatchEvent()` docblock in `EntityRepository`); it changes #1852's documented behavior and needs its own blast-radius pass.
- **Stateful PRE/POST listener pairing caveat:** listeners that capture state in PRE and read it in POST (the audit listeners' `pendingIsNew`) now see all of a batch's PRE events before any POST event (`pre1, pre2, …, post1, post2, …`). For mixed new/updated batches the captured value can be stale by the time the paired POST fires — a pre-existing stateful-listener limitation (the old order was equally wrong in a different way: PRE fired post-commit when `isNew()` was already false, so batch writes always audited as "update"). Single saves are unaffected.

### EntityConstants

File: `packages/entity/src/EntityConstants.php`

```php
final class EntityConstants
{
    public const SAVED_NEW = 1;
    public const SAVED_UPDATED = 2;
}
```

## EntityType Definition

File: `packages/entity/src/EntityType.php`

`EntityType` is a `final readonly class` implementing `EntityTypeInterface`. **Post-M1, the canonical entry point for content entity types is `EntityType::fromClass()`** — the class itself is the spec. The constructor no longer accepts a `fieldDefinitions:` parameter; field definitions are derived from `#[Field]`-decorated typed properties on the entity class.

### Attribute-first definition (canonical)

```php
// src/Entity/Note.php
namespace App\Entity;

use Waaseyaa\Entity\Attribute\ContentEntityKeys;
use Waaseyaa\Entity\Attribute\ContentEntityType;
use Waaseyaa\Entity\Attribute\Field;
use Waaseyaa\Entity\ContentEntityBase;

#[ContentEntityType(id: 'note', label: 'Note', description: 'Free-form authored content.')]
#[ContentEntityKeys(label: 'title', bundle: 'bundle', langcode: 'langcode')]
final class Note extends ContentEntityBase
{
    #[Field] public string $title;
    #[Field(type: 'text')] public ?string $body;
    #[Field(default: 'draft')] public string $status;
}
```

```php
// In NoteServiceProvider::register():
$this->entityType(EntityType::fromClass(Note::class));
```

`EntityType::fromClass(string $class, ...$overrides): self` reads the class-level `#[ContentEntityType]` and `#[ContentEntityKeys]` plus all `#[Field]`-decorated properties, infers the field shape from each property's PHP type (with `FieldTypeInferrer`), and returns a fully-formed `EntityType`. Named arguments after `$class` override any inferred slot (`storageClass`, `keys`, `revisionable`, `bundleEntityType`, `constraints`, etc.).

`#[Field]` accepts a `stored: FieldStorage` parameter (default `FieldStorage::Column`) that `EntityMetadataReader::resolveFields()` forwards verbatim into `FieldDefinition`. Properties that should live in the `_data` JSON blob (low-traffic universals like `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at` on bundle-partitioned entities) declare `#[Field(stored: FieldStorage::Data)]` directly — no fallback to raw `EntityType()` construction is needed.

**Menu-link object targets.** `menu_link` keeps presentation and destination
identity separate. `title` is only the rendered label. An object-backed link
stores its optional polymorphic destination in the public scalar fields
`target_entity_type` and `target_entity_id`; a title-only JSON:API update must
round-trip both values unchanged. Consumers resolve object-backed hrefs from
that pair rather than deriving a slug from `title`. Custom links continue to
use `url`. The existing `target` field remains the browser browsing-context
target (`_self`, `_blank`, and similar) and is not an entity reference.

### Static analysis of `#[Field]`

`packages/entity/src/PhpStan/FieldAttributeRule.php` is a custom PHPStan rule that lints `#[Field]` usage at static-analysis time so attribute typos and misuses surface in CI rather than at kernel boot. It mirrors `FieldTypeInferrer::infer()`'s checks exactly — error messages produced by the rule are byte-identical to the runtime `EntityMetadataException` messages you would see at registration time, enforced by a runtime cross-check in `FieldAttributeRuleTest`.

The rule emits one of these stable identifiers when a misuse is detected:

| Identifier | Triggered when |
|------------|----------------|
| `field.notEntity`        | `#[Field]` is placed on a property of a class that does not extend `ContentEntityBase` (cascade gate — suppresses the other identifiers for that property). |
| `field.nonPublic`        | `#[Field]` is on a non-public property. |
| `field.cannotInfer`      | No explicit `type:` argument is given and the property's PHP type is missing, a union, or an intersection. |
| `field.unknownType`      | An explicit `type:` value is not in `FieldTypeInferrer::VALID_TYPE_IDS` (the 16 registered field-type ids). |
| `field.incompatibleType` | An explicit `type:` is incompatible with the property's PHP type per `FieldTypeInferrer::compatibilityGroups()`. |

The rule is registered through a package-local config `packages/entity/phpstan-rules.neon`, included from this monorepo's repo-root `phpstan.neon`. Downstream apps depending on `waaseyaa/entity` opt in with one line in their own `phpstan.neon`:

```neon
includes:
    - vendor/waaseyaa/entity/phpstan-rules.neon
```

The rule depends only on PHPStan's `Rule` interface and `ReflectionProvider` — it has no dependency on the kernel, the DI container, or any runtime service, so it runs purely from source files at PHPStan-level analysis. It runs at PHPStan level 5 or higher and adds no measurable wall-clock cost (warm-run median on `packages/entity/src` is within noise of parity, well under the 10% ceiling — see `kitty-specs/attribute-first-entity-static-analysis-01KQ6XW7/notes/benchmark.md`).

The `Waaseyaa\Entity\Attribute\Field` attribute supports: `name:`, `type:`, `required:`, `default:`, `settings:`, plus other slots aligned with `FieldDefinition`. Omitted parameters fall through to inference from the PHP property type. See [`quickstart.md`](../../kitty-specs/attribute-first-entity-definition-01KQ6DXE/quickstart.md) for the full inference table.

### Raw constructor (advanced / non-content uses)

The `EntityType` constructor remains available for non-content entity types, generated registrations (e.g., from manifests), and tests. Named parameters:

```php
new EntityType(
    id: 'node',
    label: 'Content',
    class: Node::class,
    storageClass: SqlEntityStorage::class,
    keys: ['id' => 'nid', 'uuid' => 'uuid', 'label' => 'title', 'bundle' => 'type'],
    revisionable: false,
    revisionDefault: false,
    translatable: false,
    bundleEntityType: 'node_type',
    tenancy: null,
    constraints: [],
    group: null,
    description: null,
);
```

Parameters of note:
- `revisionDefault: bool` -- whether new revisions are created by default on save (when `revisionable` is true)
- `group: ?string` -- admin sidebar group key (e.g., `'content'`, `'taxonomy'`) for catalog grouping
- `description: ?string` -- human-readable description of the entity type, displayed in admin catalog
- `tenancy: ?array` -- opt-in declarative tenancy scope (C1, mission #1257); `['scope' => 'community']` enables `CommunityScope` wiring without requiring the entity class to implement `HasCommunityInterface`. `null` (default) means non-tenant. Lives next to entity-keys / bundle-entity-type. See **Community Scoping** below for wiring + deprecation cycle.

> **Note:** the constructor's previous `fieldDefinitions:` parameter was removed in M1. Tests that need to inject raw field definitions for fixture entity types can use `Waaseyaa\Entity\Tests\Helper\TestEntityType::stub()`.

For multi-bundle entity types (those declaring `bundleEntityType`), fields may additionally be registered per-bundle via `EntityTypeManager::addBundleFields()`. `ContentEntityBase::getFieldDefinitions()` returns the union of core fields plus the active bundle's fields. See [`bundle-scoped-fields.md`](./bundle-scoped-fields.md) for the full contract.

Entity types are registered explicitly with `EntityTypeManager::registerEntityType()`. The manager throws `\InvalidArgumentException` if a type ID is already registered.

### Compiled content-entity discovery

File: `packages/entity/src/Attribute/EntityTypeAttribute.php`

`#[ContentEntityType]` is the canonical metadata and compiled-discovery marker.
When `entity_auto_register` is enabled, `PackageManifestCompiler` records concrete
content entities and `ProviderRegistry` hydrates the same `EntityType::fromClass()`
definition used by explicit providers. Existing provider registration remains
valid and wins before auto-registration. `#[AsEntityType]` plus
`DefinesEntityType` is retained only as a deprecated compatibility path.

The attribute's `api` flag defaults to `false`. `EntityType` implements
`ApiExposableEntityTypeInterface`; generic API routing is enabled only when that
capability returns true and the application-level API exposure policy does not
narrow it. Raw `new EntityType(..., api: true)` registration is the imperative
escape hatch for dynamic or conditional definitions; it is still only a
capability ceiling, never a bypass of `api.entity_type_allowlist`. The effective
policy belongs to the API adapter and does not mutate or replace the canonical
entity definition.

## Known Transitional Gaps (M1)

The M1 *attribute-first entity definition* mission shipped the canonical surface (`#[Field]`, `EntityType::fromClass()`, extended `#[ContentEntityType]`). The list below captures gaps surfaced during M1 implementation that are **deliberately deferred** to follow-on missions. Each entry names the workaround callers should use today and the mission that resolves it.

### 1. `EntityMetadataReader` cache is per-process only

`EntityMetadataReader` and `FieldTypeInferrer` cache resolved class metadata in-memory for the duration of a single PHP request/CLI process. There is **no persistent cache** in M1 — each process pays the reflection cost on first access for each entity class. This is acceptable for current load. Production deployments wanting cross-process caching can layer one of: APCu (`apcu_store`/`apcu_fetch`), opcache preloading (PHP 7.4+), or generated metadata files emitted at deploy time. **This is a deferred optimization, not an M1 deliverable** — there is no follow-on mission filed for it yet because no benchmark has demonstrated it as a hot path.

### 2. Field-type plugin gaps in M1

Two specific PHP property types map to fallbacks in M1 because the matching field-type plugins haven't been implemented yet. When the proper plugins ship, entities can update their `#[Field]` attributes from the fallback to the canonical type without any other code changes.

**`timestamp` field type missing.** Properties intended to store Unix-epoch timestamps (`User.created`, `UserBlock.created_at`, `Node.created`, `Node.changed`, the engagement and messaging timestamp fields, etc.) currently use:

```php
#[Field(type: 'integer', settings: ['subtype' => 'timestamp'])]
public int $created;
```

A future `field-type-timestamp-plugin` mission will ship the proper plugin so the canonical declaration becomes `#[Field(type: 'timestamp')] public int $created;`.

**Closed: `enum` field type missing.** Resolved by mission [`field-type-enum-plugin-01KQ6SJG`](../../kitty-specs/field-type-enum-plugin-01KQ6SJG/). Backed-enum properties now resolve to the dedicated `'enum'` field-type plugin (`packages/field/src/Item/EnumItem.php`), which owns validation against the declared cases and emits JSON Schema with explicit `enum: [...]`. The canonical declaration is:

```php
#[Field(type: 'enum', settings: ['enum_class' => CourseStatus::class])]
public CourseStatus $status;
```

`FieldTypeInferrer` emits `type: 'enum'` automatically for backed-enum-typed properties, so most callers can omit `type:` and `settings:` entirely. The transitional `'string' + settings.enum_class` bridge in `FieldDefinitionConstraintBuilder` has been removed; the setting is honored only on `'enum'`-typed fields. The `enumClass` (camelCase) settings alias has also been removed in favor of `enum_class` (snake_case).

*Documented follow-ups carried forward from this mission:* (1) the per-definition `FieldTypeInterface::jsonSchemaFor()` path is currently exercised only by tests — no production `FieldDefinition` construction site threads the `FieldTypeManager` yet, because doing so requires converting `EntityMetadataReader`'s static API to instance-based and updating its caller sites; (2) `FieldDefinition::legacyJsonSchema()` lacks an explicit `'enum'` arm and falls through to `['type' => 'string']`, which is unreached today but will need attention once production wiring lands. A follow-up mission ("plumb `FieldTypeManager` into `EntityMetadataReader` and add the `'enum'` arm to `legacyJsonSchema`") is recommended.

### 3. `#[Field]` attribute gaps surfaced by M1

**~~No `stored:` parameter on `#[Field]`.~~** **Closed in mission `field-attribute-stored-parameter-01KQ8G29`.** `#[Field]` now exposes `stored: FieldStorage` (default `FieldStorage::Column`); `EntityMetadataReader::resolveFields()` forwards it into `FieldDefinition`. The `groups/Group` entity is migrated to attribute-first declaration and `GroupsServiceProvider` registers via `EntityType::fromClass()` — the `_fieldDefinitions:` slot is no longer used here.

**~~`entity_reference` is rejected on scalar PHP types by `FieldTypeInferrer`.~~** **Closed in mission `inferrer-entity-reference-compat-01KQ6SC0`.** `FieldTypeInferrer::isCompatible()` now accepts an asymmetric override rule: `int`/`?int`/`string`/`?string` PHP types may be explicitly overridden to `#[Field(type: 'entity_reference', ...)]`. The reverse direction is still rejected — `entity_reference` is never *inferred* from a bare scalar — and `bool`/`float`/etc. continue to raise the existing conflict diagnostic. `Node.uid` and `Term.parent_id` are migrated to the typed form:

```php
#[Field(type: 'entity_reference', settings: ['target_entity_type_id' => 'user'])]
public ?int $uid = null;
```

`FieldTypeInferrer::isCompatible(string $inferred, string $explicit): bool` is the canonical public seam consumed by both runtime (`FieldTypeInferrer::infer()`) and the `FieldAttributeRule` PHPStan extension — single source of truth for compatibility decisions, including the asymmetric `entity_reference` rule. The symmetric `compatibilityGroups()` public seam is unchanged; it remains the contract for "either-side-may-override" groups.

### 4. Provider stub still emits legacy form

The CLI scaffold at `packages/cli/stubs/provider-domain.stub` still emits `new EntityType(... fieldDefinitions: ...)` because WP05 only updated the entity-class scaffold. New entities scaffolded via `bin/waaseyaa make:entity` will produce a working entity class but a service-provider stub that uses the (now-removed) `fieldDefinitions:` parameter. This is a known migration site for a small documentation / scaffolding follow-up; the entity-class portion of the scaffold is correct.

## Entity Lifecycle

### Create

1. Call `$storage->create(['title' => 'Hello'])` or `new Node(['title' => 'Hello'])`
2. `EntityBase::__construct()` auto-generates UUID via `Uuid::v4()->toRfc4122()` if not provided
3. Entity starts with `isNew() === true` (id is null)

### Save (via EntityRepository)

The `EntityRepository::save()` pipeline (used for all high-level persistence):

1. Validates entity against the combined constraint map (`EntityTypeValidationConstraints::forEntityType()`) if `$validate === true` and an `EntityValidator` is configured (the kernel default since alpha.204; throws `EntityValidationException` here, before any storage write)
2. Calls `$entity->preSave($isNew)` lifecycle hook (if entity extends `EntityBase`)
3. Dispatches `EntityEvents::PRE_SAVE` event (via `EntityEventFactoryInterface`)
4. Writes to storage driver via `$driver->write()`, which returns the effective id of the persisted row (the backend-assigned pk for empty-id inserts, the caller-supplied id otherwise)
5. For new entities with an empty id, back-fills the assigned pk via `$entity->set($idKey, $writtenId)` so POST_SAVE listeners see the real id
6. Calls `$entity->enforceIsNew(false)` for new entities
7. Dispatches `EntityEvents::POST_SAVE` event
8. Calls `$entity->postSave($isNew)` lifecycle hook (if entity extends `EntityBase`)
9. Returns `EntityConstants::SAVED_NEW` (1) or `SAVED_UPDATED` (2)

**Optimistic locking (#1647, mission optimistic-locking-01KTXCHY).** The save
accepts an optional expectation via `SaveContext::withExpectedRevisionId(int $n)`
("I am updating the entity as of revision `n`"). When stated, a conflict check
runs between step 1 (validation — which still wins: an invalid + conflicted
save reports `EntityValidationException`) and step 2: a head mismatch throws
`RevisionConflictException` **before any write, hook, or lifecycle event**, and
a guarded pointer-claim UPDATE inside the write transaction closes the race —
exactly one of any set of concurrent saves stating the same expectation
commits. Honored only on revision-creating saves of single-axis revisionable
types; a stated expectation anywhere else (new entity, non-revisionable type,
two-axis type, non-revision-creating save, no `DatabaseInterface`, no revision
driver) throws `\LogicException` — a caller programming error, distinct by type
from the `RevisionConflictException` data race; callers may rely on the
distinction. **No expectation = byte-identical legacy behavior** (every
conflict branch skipped, zero added queries). Full mechanics, the rejection
matrix, and null-current semantics: `docs/specs/revision-system-unified.md`
§3b.

**Pointer-move operations are a separate pre-write choke point (CW-v1 WP-2 task 2.4, #1920).**
`rollback()`, `setCurrentRevision()`, `setPublishedRevision()`, and the `saveTranslationRevision()` /
`saveTranslationRevisions()` / `saveTranslation()` trio move the revision pointer (or, for
`rollback()`, copy a revision forward) WITHOUT going through this `save()` pipeline at all — no
`EntityEvents::PRE_SAVE`/`POST_SAVE`. Each dispatches `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Event\BeforeRevisionPointerMoveEvent`
(by FQCN) before any write instead; a subscriber denies by throwing `AbortOperationException`,
leaving storage untouched (including transactional rollback of any earlier write in the same
transaction, for the multi-write translation paths). Full contract, payload shape, and the
`Waaseyaa\Workflows\Listener\WorkflowPointerMoveGuard` consumer: `docs/specs/revision-system-unified.md`
§4a.

### Save (via SqlEntityStorage — low-level)

1. `SqlEntityStorage::save()` detects `isNew() === true`
2. Calls `splitForStorage()` to separate schema columns from `_data` JSON blob
3. Dispatches `EntityEvents::PRE_SAVE` event
4. Runs `INSERT` via `$database->insert()`, omitting null id key (auto-increment)
5. Sets the generated ID on entity via `$entity->set($idKey, (int)$id)`
6. Calls `$entity->enforceIsNew(false)`
7. Dispatches `EntityEvents::POST_SAVE` event
8. Returns `EntityConstants::SAVED_NEW` (1)

### Delete (via EntityRepository)

1. Calls `$entity->preDelete()` lifecycle hook (if entity extends `EntityBase`)
2. Dispatches `EntityEvents::PRE_DELETE` event
3. Removes from storage driver (`$driver->remove()`)
4. Dispatches `EntityEvents::POST_DELETE` event
5. Calls `$entity->postDelete()` lifecycle hook (if entity extends `EntityBase`)

### Load

1. `SqlEntityStorage::load($id)` executes `SELECT` on entity table
2. `mapRowToEntity()` casts numeric IDs to `int`
3. Merges `_data` JSON blob back into the values array
4. Instantiates entity via `EntityInstantiator` (see **Hydration from storage** below)
5. Calls `$entity->enforceIsNew(false)` on loaded entities

## Storage Layer

### SqlEntityStorage

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/SqlEntityStorage.php`
Namespace: `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage`
Class: `final class SqlEntityStorage implements EntityStorageInterface`

Constructor:
```php
public function __construct(
    private readonly EntityTypeInterface $entityType,
    private readonly DatabaseInterface $database,
    private readonly EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher,
    ?LoggerInterface $logger = null,
    ?EntityEventFactoryInterface $eventFactory = null,
    ?SqlEntityQueryResultCache $queryResultCache = null,
    ?\Waaseyaa\Entity\DateTime\EntityClockInterface $clock = null,
)
```

`$logger` defaults to `NullLogger`. `$eventFactory` defaults to `DefaultEntityEventFactory`. The logger is from `Waaseyaa\Foundation\Log\LoggerInterface` (not PSR-3).

**Query result cache**: Each storage instance holds a request-scoped `SqlEntityQueryResultCache`. `getQuery()` wires it into `SqlEntityQuery` so repeated identical `EntityQueryInterface::execute()` calls avoid round-trips. After a successful `save()` or `delete()` that touches the table, the cache for that entity type is invalidated (all fingerprints for the type), so list/count queries see new mutations.

**`loadByKey()`**: Implements `EntityStorageInterface::loadByKey()` using the query+load pattern.

**Automatic timestamp population (#1183):** `SqlEntityStorage::save()` calls `populateTimestamps()` before PRE_SAVE. It uses an injectable {@see \Waaseyaa\Entity\DateTime\EntityClockInterface} (default {@see \Waaseyaa\Entity\DateTime\UtcEntityClock}) so tests and jobs can freeze time. For each field with `'type' => 'timestamp'`, {@see \Waaseyaa\Entity\DateTime\TimestampFieldConvention} resolves:

- **Role:** `auto_populate` in the field definition (`create`, `update`, or `false` to disable). If omitted, names `created` / `created_at` imply `create` (only when the raw storage value is unset), and `changed` / `updated_at` / `modified_at` imply `update` (every save). Other timestamp fields do not auto-fill unless `auto_populate` is set.
- **Scalar shape:** If the entity defines a `datetime_immutable` cast for that field, storage passes `DateTimeImmutable` through `set()` so `ValueCaster::castOut` applies (including `storage` unix vs iso8601). Otherwise `storage_format` on the field definition selects `unix` (int) vs `iso8601` (`DateTimeInterface::ATOM` string), with defaults: `created` / `changed` → unix; `*_at` suffix → iso8601; other names → unix.

Unset detection for the `create` role uses the raw `toArray()` bag (not cast-aware `get()`), so `0` / missing key / empty string still count as unset.

Table name derived from `$entityType->id()` (e.g., entity type `'node'` maps to table `node`).

**Known tech-debt — size / decomposition (audit D-21, tracked).** This class is ~1560 LOC and intentionally co-locates four distinct storage models behind one `EntityStorageInterface`: (1) flat non-translatable (`save()`/`load()` → `insertBaseRow()`/`updateBaseRow()`), (2) `_data`-blob translatable (`saveTranslatable()`/`loadTranslatable()` + `insert/updateTranslatableEntity()`), (3) SQL-column translatable (`saveSqlColumnTranslatable()`/`loadSqlColumnTranslatable()` + the `*SqlColumnTranslation*` helpers), and (4) per-bundle subtable merge (`bundleGateway()` + `mergeBundleSubtableRow()`/`mergeBundleSubtableRowsBatch()`). The column/`_data` split helper (`splitForStorage()`) is already shared across the non-translatable path and partly mirrored by `getDataStoredCoreFieldNames()`. The intended decomposition is to extract the translatable save/load paths (models 2–3) into a `TranslatableSqlPersister` collaborator and have both it and `SqlEntityStorage` consume one shared column/`_data` split helper. This is deferred, not abandoned: the extraction touches the framework's most correctness- and security-sensitive write paths — per-langcode translatable persistence (FR-021/FR-024), the deliberately-open `_data` mass-assignment write boundary (see below; pinned by `SqlEntityStorageDataBlobMassAssignmentTest`), and the transactional bundle-subtable upsert/rollback — so it is sequenced as its own change behind full regression coverage rather than folded into an unrelated remediation pass.

### _data JSON Blob

`SqlSchemaHandler::buildTableSpec()` adds a `_data TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` column to every entity table.

`SqlEntityStorage::splitForStorage()`:
- For each value key, checks if a matching column exists in the table (via `SchemaInterface::fieldExists()`, results cached in `$columnCache`)
- Values matching real columns go into `$dbValues`
- All other values go into `$extraData`, which is JSON-encoded into `_data`

`SqlEntityStorage::mapRowToEntity()`:
- If `$row['_data']` exists, `json_decode()` it and merge back into `$row`
- Remove the `_data` key from the row before entity creation

**Security - mass-assignment and the write boundary (intentional).** `splitForStorage()` persists every value key it receives, including keys with no registered `FieldDefinition` (they land in `_data`). This is deliberate: the open `_data` blob is the documented home for extension fields, `mergeCoreFields` overlays, and ad-hoc attributes, and the framework's own security-critical User fields (`pass` the password hash, `roles`, `permissions`) are stored as unregistered `_data` keys (see `packages/user/src/User.php`). A registered-field allowlist at this boundary is explicitly rejected: it would silently drop `pass`, `roles`, and `permissions` on every User save (breaking authentication and authorization) plus `node.body` and any host `_data` overlay, while providing no real protection, because `splitForStorage()` is identity-blind (it receives no `AccountInterface`) and cannot distinguish a legitimate admin role assignment from an attacker. Which actor may write which field is an authorization decision, enforced one layer up where the account is known: per-field `FieldAccessPolicyInterface::fieldAccess()` (for example `UserAccessPolicy` forbids `roles`, `permissions`, `status`, `email_verified` for non-admins and `pass` plus two-factor material for everyone), evaluated by `EntityAccessHandler::checkFieldAccess()` and called on every submitted attribute by the JSON:API write path (`JsonApiController` create and update), `FieldAutoSaveController`, and `TranslationController`. The write boundary stays a pure persistence primitive; the request surface owns mass-assignment defense. Regression coverage: `packages/entity-storage/tests/Unit/SqlEntityStorageDataBlobMassAssignmentTest.php`.

### Per-Bundle Subtables (Bundle-Scoped Storage)

Multi-bundle entity types (declaring `bundleEntityType`) may register bundle-specific fields via `EntityTypeManager::addBundleFields($entityTypeId, $bundleId, $fieldDefinitions)`. Those fields are materialized as a dedicated subtable per bundle rather than sharing the base table or the `_data` blob. By default, `SqlSchemaHandler` discovers which bundles to materialize via `FieldDefinitionRegistry::bundleNamesFor($entityTypeId)` — the same registry source `SqlEntityStorage` uses for save-time partitioning — so schema-side and write-side agree on which bundles are "known". An optional `bundleEnumerator` closure on the handler is the escape hatch for callers that need to enumerate bundles beyond the registry (declared-but-empty bundles from bundle-entity-type config, pre-flight rebuilds). See [`bundle-scoped-storage.md`](./bundle-scoped-storage.md) for the full contract; the summary below captures the substrate the spec references.

**Naming.** Subtables are named `{base_table}__{bundle}` (double-underscore separator). The canonical formatter is the static `SqlSchemaHandler::resolveSubtableName($baseTable, $bundle, ?$entityTypeId)`; the instance method `bundleSubtableName($bundle)` is a thin wrapper that supplies the handler's own base table and entity type id. The static helper is the single source of truth shared by `SqlSchemaHandler`, `SqlEntityStorage`, and `SqlEntityQuery` — there is no raw `'__'` concatenation elsewhere. Bundle ids containing `__` throw `\InvalidArgumentException` at the formatting boundary, and the structural guard at `EntityTypeManager::addBundleFields()` rejects them earlier still at registration time, so storage and query paths are never reached with a malformed bundle id (mission #1257 WP03, K1; closes #1298).

**Schema.** `SqlSchemaHandler::ensureBundleSubtable($bundleId, $fieldSchemas)` creates `{base}__{bundle}` with:
- `entity_id` column matching the base table's id key type, declared as the subtable's PRIMARY KEY.
- One column per registered bundle field (type translated via `deriveColumnSpec()`).
- Foreign key `entity_id → {base}.{idKey}` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. FK enforcement requires `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` on SQLite and is default-on for MySQL/InnoDB and PostgreSQL. `HealthChecker::checkForeignKeysEnabled()` emits `FK_ENFORCEMENT_DISABLED` if the probe shows FKs off.

**Field registry partitioning.** `FieldDefinitionRegistry` (implements `FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface`, extracted for cross-package consumption under `packages/entity/src/Field/`) keeps core-field and per-bundle-field maps separate. `ContentEntityBase::getFieldDefinitions()` returns the union of core plus the active bundle; entities created with an unknown bundle see only core fields.

**Incremental core fields (`mergeCoreFields`).** Packages register their baseline core set via `registerCoreFields()`. Host applications may then call `FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface::mergeCoreFields(string $entityTypeId, array $fields)` to append additional **core** fields (same value shapes as `registerCoreFields`: metadata arrays or `FieldDefinitionInterface` instances). Use this for product-only overlays (feature flags, optional references stored in `_data`, etc.) without subclassing or replacing the package `EntityType`. New names must not collide with existing core fields; the implementation rejects duplicates. After merge, storage partitioning, schema materialization, validation, and query field resolution all treat the added definitions like any other core field.

**Field-binding invariant (alpha.171+).** Every `FieldDefinition` passed to `FieldDefinitionRegistry::registerCoreFields($entityTypeId, …)` or `registerBundleFields($entityTypeId, $bundle, …)` MUST declare `targetEntityTypeId` equal to that `$entityTypeId`. Both registration paths reject the bind with `\InvalidArgumentException` on any mismatch. Bundle paths additionally enforce `targetBundle === $bundle`. Entity packages register canonical field metadata through the `EntityType` built from their entity classes; a parallel static field-definition catalogue is not a registration path.

**Write path.** `SqlEntityStorage::save()` calls `partitionBundleValues()` to split values into core (base table), active-bundle (subtable), and foreign-bundle buckets. Foreign-bundle writes throw `\InvalidArgumentException` — attempts to write fields belonging to a different bundle fail loud rather than silently populating `_data`. After the base-table row is written, `persistBundleRow()` upserts into the subtable inside the same `$database->transaction()`, so subtable failure rolls back the base insert/update and suppresses POST_SAVE. The upsert is a portable SELECT-then-INSERT-or-UPDATE (DBAL has no portable upsert); a small race window under concurrent writes surfaces as a PK collision on the loser — acceptable for current load.

**Read path.** `SqlEntityStorage::load()` merges the base row with `mergeBundleSubtableRow()`, which LEFT JOINs (or selects) the subtable matching the entity's active bundle. When the subtable is missing (mid-migration: fields registered but `ensureBundleSubtable()` not yet run), the load returns core values and emits a single `[MISSING_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE]` notice for the affected `(entity_type, bundle)` — once per storage instance, independent of the save-time notice (mission #1257 WP06, K4). `HealthChecker` continues to catch the same condition during operator scans via the `MISSING_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` diagnostic.

**Query path.** `SqlEntityQuery` resolves bundle-scoped fields by JOINing `{base}__{bundle}` on demand. A bundle filter narrows the JOIN set; queries without a bundle filter that reference a field belonging to multiple bundles throw `BundleAmbiguousFieldException` (listing the conflicting bundles) rather than silently picking one. `UnknownFieldException` is thrown when the field resolves against neither core nor any registered bundle.

**Runtime notice follow-up.** `SqlEntityStorage::save()` now emits a `LoggerInterface::notice()` with diagnostic code `MISSING_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` when bundle-scoped values are present but the matching `{base}__{bundle}` subtable is still absent at save time. The notice belongs on the save path rather than `addBundleFields()` because registration is pre-materialization and would false-positive on healthy boots.

**Read–write routing parity (K2, mission #1257 WP04).** `SqlEntityQuery::resolveField()` consults `SqlEntityQuery::getDataStoredCoreFieldNames()` (memoized; mirrors `SqlEntityStorage::getDataStoredCoreFieldNames()` on the write side — both iterate `FieldDefinitionRegistry::coreFieldsFor()` and check each `FieldDefinition::getStored() === FieldStorage::Data`). The registry hint wins over `SchemaInterface::fieldExists()`: when a core field has the `FieldStorage::Data` hint, `resolveField()` short-circuits to `json_extract(_data, '$.field')` *before* the column lookup, so a lingering legacy column cannot shadow the read. No silent dual-source: if a field has been promoted to `FieldStorage::Data` while a legacy column still exists in the table, both write and read paths agree the canonical home is `_data`.

**Drift diagnostics.** Three `DiagnosticCode` cases back this substrate, all surfaced by `HealthChecker`:
- `MISSING_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` (error) — bundle has registered fields but no subtable.
- `ORPHAN_BUNDLE_SUBTABLE` (warning) — subtable exists with no matching registered bundle. Current detection queries `sqlite_master` and is SQLite-only; portable enumeration is tracked as issue #1301.
- `FK_ENFORCEMENT_DISABLED` (error) — PRAGMA probe returned `foreign_keys = 0` on SQLite.

`HealthChecker` itself sits in `packages/foundation` (layer 0) and currently imports from layer 1 (`EntityTypeInterface`, `FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface`, `SqlSchemaHandler`). The nullable registry ctor parameter mitigates coupling but not import direction; architectural cleanup is tracked as issue #1300.

### SqlSchemaHandler

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/SqlSchemaHandler.php`
Class: `final class SqlSchemaHandler`

Constructor: `(EntityTypeInterface $entityType, DatabaseInterface $database, ?FieldDefinitionRegistryInterface $fieldRegistry = null, ?\Closure $bundleEnumerator = null, ?LoggerInterface $logger = null)` — the optional logger receives `warning` events when `deriveColumnSpec()` encounters an unknown field type (see below); callers that omit it get `NullLogger`.

Key methods:
- `ensureTable(): void` -- creates entity table if it does not exist
- `ensureTranslationTable(array $translatableFieldSchemas = []): void` -- creates `{type}_translations` table
- `addFieldColumns(array $fieldSchemas): void` -- adds columns to existing entity table
- `addTranslationFieldColumns(array $fieldSchemas): void` -- adds columns to translation table
- `getTableName(): string` -- returns entity type id
- `getTranslationTableName(): string` -- returns `{type}_translations`

**Field type → SQL column.** `deriveColumnSpec(string $fieldType, array $fieldDef): array` maps field-definition type strings to column shapes consumed by the schema layer (`type`, optional `length`, etc.), including explicit handling for `text_long`, `uri`, and `entity_reference`. Unknown types log at `warning` and fall back to `text`. Full mapping table, URI length default, `FieldStorage::Data` note, and vendor nuance: [`field/column-derivation.md`](./field/column-derivation.md).

### EntitySchemaSync

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/EntitySchemaSync.php`
Class: `final class EntitySchemaSync`

Constructor: `(DatabaseInterface $database)`

Key methods:
- `syncAll(iterable $entityTypes): void` -- iterates `EntityTypeInterface` instances and calls `SqlSchemaHandler::ensureTable()` on each

Thin wrapper around `SqlSchemaHandler` so application migrations and install commands can materialize tables for many registered entity types in one call without repeating construction boilerplate. Idempotent by delegation (`ensureTable()` is a no-op when the table exists).

Default table schema (from `buildTableSpec()`):
- `{idKey}` -- `serial NOT NULL` (auto-increment primary key)
- `{uuidKey}` -- `varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`
- `{bundleKey}` -- `varchar(128) NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`
- `{labelKey}` -- `varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`
- `{langcodeKey}` -- `varchar(12) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'en'`
- `_data` -- `text NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`
- Primary key on `{idKey}`, unique index on UUID, index on bundle

### EntityStorageFactory

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/EntityStorageFactory.php`
Class: `final class EntityStorageFactory`

Constructor: `(DatabaseInterface $database, EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher, ?EntityEventFactoryInterface $eventFactory = null)`

`getStorage(EntityTypeInterface $entityType): SqlEntityStorage` -- creates and caches SqlEntityStorage instances by entity type ID. Propagates `$eventFactory` to each SqlEntityStorage instance.

### EntityRepository

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/EntityRepository.php`
Class: `final class EntityRepository implements EntityRepositoryInterface`

Constructor:
```php
public function __construct(
    private readonly EntityTypeInterface $entityType,
    private readonly EntityStorageDriverInterface $driver,
    private readonly EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher,
    private readonly ?RevisionableStorageDriver $revisionDriver = null,
    private readonly ?DatabaseInterface $database = null,
    ?EntityEventFactoryInterface $eventFactory = null,
    private readonly ?EntityValidator $validator = null,
)
```

Higher-level layer that handles:
- Entity hydration (`hydrate()` method with `_data` merge and constructor adaptation)
- Language fallback via `setFallbackChain(string[] $chain)` (default: `['en']`)
- Event dispatch via `EntityEventFactoryInterface` (defaults to `DefaultEntityEventFactory`)
- Pre-save validation via `EntityValidator` (injected by default by the kernel since alpha.204, `validate: true`) using `EntityTypeValidationConstraints::forEntityType()` (derived from field definitions, plus per-field declared constraints appended, plus manual `getConstraints()` per-field override)
- Entity lifecycle hooks (`preSave`, `postSave`, `preDelete`, `postDelete` on `EntityBase`)
- Batch operations via `saveMany()`/`deleteMany()` with `UnitOfWork` transaction wrapping
- Batch reads via `findMany(array $ids, ...)` delegating to `EntityStorageDriverInterface::readMultiple()`
- Revision management via `loadRevision()` and `rollback()`
- Automatic revision creation based on `EntityType::getRevisionDefault()` and per-entity `isNewRevision()` override (via `shouldCreateRevision()` internal method)

### UnitOfWork

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/UnitOfWork.php`
Class: `final class UnitOfWork`

Constructor: `(DatabaseInterface $database, EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher)`

`transaction(\Closure $callback): mixed` -- wraps callback in DB transaction, buffers events during transaction, dispatches after commit. On failure, discards events and rolls back.

`bufferEvent(Event $event, string $eventName): void` -- buffers events inside transaction, dispatches immediately outside.

Since 2026-07-02 (WP2 review) only POST/AFTER lifecycle events are routed through `bufferEvent()` on the save path — PRE-write events (`PRE_SAVE`, `BeforeSaveEvent`) dispatch immediately inside the transaction. See "Event dispatch semantics under `UnitOfWork`" above.

### Storage Drivers

#### EntityStorageDriverInterface

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/Driver/EntityStorageDriverInterface.php`

Low-level I/O SPI without entity hydration or events:

```php
public function read(string $entityType, string $id, ?string $langcode = null): ?array;
public function readMultiple(string $entityType, array $ids, ?string $langcode = null): array;
public function write(string $entityType, string $id, array $values): void;
public function remove(string $entityType, string $id): void;
public function exists(string $entityType, string $id): bool;
public function count(string $entityType, array $criteria = []): int;
public function findBy(string $entityType, array $criteria = [], ?array $orderBy = null, ?int $limit = null): array;
```

#### SqlStorageDriver

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/Driver/SqlStorageDriver.php`
Constructor: `(ConnectionResolverInterface $connectionResolver, string $idKey = 'id', ?CommunityScope $communityScope = null)`

Handles raw SQL I/O. Supports translation tables: if `{entityType}_translations` table exists, `read()` merges translation data over base values. `readMultiple()` loads many IDs in one `IN` query with the same translation merge rules as repeated `read()` calls.

When `$communityScope` is injected and active, all read/findBy/count/exists/remove operations add `WHERE community_id = ?` automatically. The `write()` method uses a scope-unaware existence check (raw ID lookup) to avoid duplicate INSERTs when the active community differs from the stored row's community, but scopes the UPDATE path to prevent cross-community overwrites. See **Community Scoping** section below.

#### InMemoryStorageDriver

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/Driver/InMemoryStorageDriver.php`
Constructor: `(?CommunityScope $communityScope = null)`

In-memory storage for testing. Accepts an optional `CommunityScope` and applies the same community isolation logic as `SqlStorageDriver` — all read/findBy/count/exists/remove operations are scoped when the context is active.

Additional methods beyond the interface:
- `writeTranslation(string $entityType, string $id, string $langcode, array $values): void`
- `deleteTranslation(string $entityType, string $id, string $langcode): void`
- `getAvailableLanguages(string $entityType, string $id): string[]`
- `clear(): void`

### Community Scoping (Multi-tenancy)

Waaseyaa supports row-level multi-tenancy via community-scoped query isolation. All entity queries are automatically restricted to the active community when a `CommunityContext` is set.

#### HasCommunityInterface / HasCommunityTrait

File: `packages/entity/src/Community/HasCommunityInterface.php`

Marker interface for entities that participate in community-scoped tenancy:

```php
interface HasCommunityInterface
{
    public function getCommunityId(): ?string;
    public function setCommunityId(string $communityId): void;
}
```

`HasCommunityTrait` provides the default implementation via `ContentEntityBase::get/set('community_id')`. Entities must declare `community_id` as a schema column.

#### CommunityScope

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/Tenancy/CommunityScope.php`

Strategy object injected into storage drivers at **wiring time**. Service providers consult `EntityType::getTenancy()` and inject `CommunityScope` when the declared scope is `'community'` (C1, mission #1257). Config entities and system entities receive no `CommunityScope`.

```php
final class CommunityScope
{
    public function __construct(CommunityContextInterface $context);
    public function isActive(): bool;
    public function getCommunityId(): string;  // throws LogicException if not active
}
```

#### Wiring pattern

```php
// In an app service provider — only for entity types declaring tenancy: ['scope' => 'community']:
$scope  = $this->resolve(CommunityScope::class);
$driver = new SqlStorageDriver($resolver, communityScope: $scope);
$repo   = new EntityRepository($entityType, $driver, $dispatcher);
```

#### Tenancy declaration (C1, mission #1257 WP10)

**Status: canonical.** Entities opt into community scoping via `EntityType` registration:

```php
new EntityType(
    id: 'group',
    class: \Waaseyaa\Groups\Group::class,
    tenancy: ['scope' => 'community'],
    // ...
);
```

`EntityType::getTenancy(): ?array` returns the declared shape (or `null` for non-tenant types). `SqlStorageDriver` and `MemoryStorageDriver` both wire `CommunityScope` based on this declaration; the entity class needs no marker interface.

**Why declarative.** Framework-shipped `final` entity classes (e.g. `Waaseyaa\Groups\Group`) cannot be marked by consumers via interface — exactly the class-hierarchy coupling that bundle-scoped fields exist to avoid. Tenancy is a **registration-site** concern, not a class-hierarchy concern.

#### Migration: `HasCommunityInterface` → declarative tenancy (mission #1257 WP10)

**Status: deprecation cycle active. Removal in next minor release.**

See `packages/groups/CHANGELOG.md` for the operator-facing migration recipe. In summary:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `class MyEntity extends ContentEntityBase implements HasCommunityInterface { use HasCommunityTrait; }` | `class MyEntity extends ContentEntityBase { /* no marker */ }` |
| Service provider: `is_a($entityType->getClass(), HasCommunityInterface::class, true)` | `EntityType` registration: `tenancy: ['scope' => 'community']` |

During the deprecation cycle, `HasCommunityInterface` continues to function — wiring still injects `CommunityScope` for entities that implement it. On first wiring per `(entity-type id)` per process, `LoggerInterface::warning()` emits a one-time deprecation notice naming the entity type and pointing to the migration recipe. Removal scheduled for the next minor release.

**Note for adopters mid-migration (e.g. Minoo).** Consumers running their own `App\Entity\Group` plus a composer dep on `waaseyaa/groups` should: (1) adopt `tenancy:` on their `EntityType` registration first; (2) verify cross-tenant isolation tests still pass; (3) only then collapse the local `App\Entity\Group` onto `Waaseyaa\Groups\Group`. Order matters because the `tenancy:` flip is wiring-local while the class collapse touches every call site.

### Connection Resolution

#### ConnectionResolverInterface

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/Connection/ConnectionResolverInterface.php`

```php
public function connection(?string $name = null): DatabaseInterface;
public function getDefaultConnectionName(): string;
```

Multi-tenancy seam. `SingleConnectionResolver` always returns the same connection.

## Constructor Patterns

### Base class constructor (EntityBase)

```php
public function __construct(array $values = [], string $entityTypeId = '', array $entityKeys = [])
```

Accepts `$entityTypeId` and `$entityKeys` parameters. Used when storage instantiates generic entities.

### Subclass constructor (User, Node)

Subclasses hardcode their entity type ID and keys. Only accept `(array $values)`:

```php
// User: packages/user/src/User.php
final class User extends ContentEntityBase implements AccountInterface
{
    private const ENTITY_TYPE_ID = 'user';
    private const ENTITY_KEYS = ['id' => 'uid', 'uuid' => 'uuid', 'label' => 'name'];

    public function __construct(array $values = [])
    {
        parent::__construct($values, self::ENTITY_TYPE_ID, self::ENTITY_KEYS);
    }
}

// Node: packages/node/src/Node.php
final class Node extends ContentEntityBase
{
    protected string $entityTypeId = 'node';
    protected array $entityKeys = ['id' => 'nid', 'uuid' => 'uuid', 'label' => 'title', 'bundle' => 'type'];

    public function __construct(array $values = [])
    {
        parent::__construct($values, $this->entityTypeId, $this->entityKeys);
    }
}
```

### Hydration from storage (`HydratableFromStorageInterface`)

File: `packages/entity/src/Hydration/HydratableFromStorageInterface.php`  
File: `packages/entity/src/Hydration/HydrationContext.php` (readonly value object: `entityTypeId`, `entityKeys`)

Entities that use a **domain constructor** (not `__construct(array $values)` alone) may implement `HydratableFromStorageInterface` and implement:

```php
public static function fromStorage(array $values, HydrationContext $context): static;
```

`$values` is the same normalized bag the legacy path would pass as `values:` (numeric id cast, `_data` merged, json-typed columns decoded in `SqlEntityStorage::mapRowToEntity()` where applicable). `$context` carries `EntityTypeInterface::id()` and `getKeys()` so implementations can call `ContentEntityBase::__construct($values, $context->entityTypeId, $context->entityKeys, …)`.

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/Hydration/EntityInstantiator.php` (`@internal` in public surface map)

`EntityRepository` and `SqlEntityStorage` delegate construction to `EntityInstantiator::instantiate(string $class, array $values)`:

1. If the class implements `HydratableFromStorageInterface`, invoke `ClassName::fromStorage($values, new HydrationContext(...))`. The result must implement `EntityInterface` or a `RuntimeException` is thrown.
2. Otherwise **legacy** reflection (same as pre-#1188): detect constructor parameter `entityTypeId`; if present, `new $class(values: …, entityTypeId: …, entityKeys: …)`; else `new $class(values: …)`.

Application-level naming: consumers may add `public static function make(array $values): self` that delegates to `fromStorage` for tests or manual hydration, using a `HydrationContext` built from the app’s registered `EntityType` keys.

**Interaction with field casting (#1181):** `fromStorage` should populate the internal values bag with **storage-canonical** scalars; cast-aware `get()`/`set()` apply afterward.

### SqlEntityStorage constructor detection (legacy path)

When `HydratableFromStorageInterface` is **not** implemented, `EntityInstantiator` uses reflection on the entity class constructor:

1. Reflects the entity class constructor
2. Checks if a parameter named `'entityTypeId'` exists
3. If yes, passes `(values: $values, entityTypeId: ..., entityKeys: ...)`
4. If no, passes `(values: $values)` only

This is critical: entity subclasses like User and Node only accept `(array $values)` and hardcode their type/keys.

### Breaking-change cutover (alpha → stable)

Breaking changes are acceptable while the framework is alpha if they reduce dual code paths. Target end state:

1. **Hydration:** Every `EntityType`-registered **content** class implements `HydratableFromStorageInterface` and `fromStorage()`; `EntityInstantiator::instantiateLegacy()` (reflection + optional `entityTypeId` ctor parameter) is removed. Until then, new entity types **must** implement the interface — the legacy branch exists only for in-repo types not yet migrated.
2. **Field definitions:** `EntityType::getFieldDefinitions()` returns only `FieldDefinitionInterface` instances (no associative metadata arrays with `'default'`, `'type'`, etc.). `SqlEntityStorage::create()` stops reading array-shaped definitions once the monorepo registrations are migrated; `SchemaPresenter` and validation already prefer objects.
3. **Migration checklist for consumer apps:** (a) add `fromStorage` + interface on each content entity; (b) replace array field defs with `FieldDefinition` builders or equivalent; (c) run storage/API tests; (d) remove widening constructors that relied on reflection-only hydration.

### enforceIsNew()

`EntityBase::enforceIsNew(bool $value = true): static`

When creating entities with pre-set IDs (e.g., `new User(['uid' => 2])`), call `$entity->enforceIsNew()` before `save()`. Without this, `isNew()` returns false (because `id()` is not null), and SqlEntityStorage performs UPDATE instead of INSERT, silently affecting 0 rows.

`isNew()` returns `$this->enforceIsNew || $this->id() === null`.

## Entity Keys

Entity keys map logical names to actual column/property names. Defined in `EntityType::$keys`:

| Key | Purpose | Default fallback |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| `id` | Primary key column | `'id'` |
| `uuid` | UUID column | `'uuid'` |
| `label` | Human-readable label | `'label'` |
| `bundle` | Bundle/type discriminator | `'bundle'` |
| `langcode` | Language code | `'langcode'` |
| `revision` | Revision ID (revisionable types) | -- |

Examples:
- Node: `['id' => 'nid', 'uuid' => 'uuid', 'label' => 'title', 'bundle' => 'type']`
- User: `['id' => 'uid', 'uuid' => 'uuid', 'label' => 'name']`

`EntityBase` resolves values via keys: `$this->values[$this->entityKeys['id'] ?? 'id']`.
Bundle defaults to `$this->entityTypeId` when no bundle value exists.

## Query Pipeline

### SqlEntityQuery

File: `packages/entity-storage/src/SqlEntityQuery.php`
Class: `final class SqlEntityQuery implements EntityQueryInterface`

Constructor: `(EntityTypeInterface $entityType, DatabaseInterface $database, ?SqlEntityQueryResultCache $resultCache = null)`

Table and ID key derived from entity type. Fluent API builds conditions, sorts, and ranges. When `$resultCache` is null (direct construction in tests), results are never memoized. `SqlEntityStorage::getQuery()` passes the storage’s cache instance.

**JSON field resolution**: `resolveField()` checks if a field exists as a real table column (cached in `$columnCache`) and returns a `ResolvedField` value object (WP6 #1816; `packages/entity-storage/src/ResolvedField.php` — `sql()` / `isExpression()` / `isJsonExtract()`). A real column is a **bare identifier** routed through the auto-quoting `SelectInterface::condition()` / `orderBy()` / `isNull()` / `isNotNull()`; a `_data` JSON-blob field is a `json_extract(...)` **expression** routed through `whereRaw()` / `orderByRaw()` (emitted verbatim — quoting an expression as an identifier would corrupt it). `SqlStorageDriver::resolveField()` (the `findBy`/`count` path) follows the same ResolvedField split. This keeps `_data` fields usable in conditions, sorts, and counts transparently while every plain/qualified identifier is now SQL-injection-quoted.

**SQL identifier hardening (audit R2 WP1)**: WP6 #1816 (above) closed injection through the *value* side of a condition and through *identifier* quoting, but the field *name* fed into the `json_extract(<alias>._data, '$.<field>')` expression string was still interpolated raw — only the filter/sort *value* is ever bound as a `?` parameter; the JSON-path field name is baked directly into the SQL text. A field name containing a single quote breaks out of the `'$.<field>'` string literal.

There are **two** such sinks, in two independent SQL query engines, reached by different call paths — both must be guarded:

1. `SqlEntityQuery::resolveField()` (three `json_extract(...)` call sites) — the `getQuery()->execute()` path. Reachable end-to-end from an anonymous JSON:API request: `QueryParser` (`packages/api/src/Query/QueryParser.php`) took the filter/sort field from the raw query-string array key with no validation, and `JsonApiController`'s pre-fix check was a deny-list (credentials + `settings['internal']`), not an allowlist — see `docs/specs/api-layer.md` "Filter/sort field allowlist (audit R2 WP1)" for the primary fix at that layer.
2. `SqlStorageDriver::resolveField()` (`packages/entity-storage/src/Driver/SqlStorageDriver.php`, one `json_extract(...)` call site) — the **twin** sink on the `EntityRepository::findBy()` / `count()` path. `EntityRepository::findBy(criteria, orderBy)` and `count(criteria)` forward their array keys to the driver verbatim, and this path is driven today by `ai-tools` `EntityListTool` (`packages/ai-tools/src/Entity/EntityListTool.php`, an `#[AsAgentTool]` whose filter/sort JSON schema is open), so attacker-chosen keys flow straight in. It is covered neither by the JSON:API allowlist (which only guards `JsonApiController`) nor by the SqlEntityQuery guard (a different class).

Both sinks now call one shared identifier allowlist, `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Query\JsonFieldName::assertQueryable(string $field): void` (`packages/entity-storage/src/Query/JsonFieldName.php`), immediately before building each json_extract expression string; it throws `\InvalidArgumentException` unless `$field` matches `/^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$/` — the shape of every real field/machine name. `SqlEntityQuery::assertQueryableJsonFieldName()` is a thin wrapper delegating to the shared helper. With both sinks guarded, the raw fragment is un-injectable regardless of which caller (JSON:API request, agent tool, or any future direct `EntityRepository::findBy()`/`count()` consumer) reaches the code path, independent of any upstream API-layer allowlist. Pinned by `packages/entity-storage/tests/Unit/SqlEntityQueryJsonFieldNameGuardTest.php` (both the `SqlEntityQuery` and `SqlStorageDriver`/`findBy` paths, plus positive controls that a valid `_data` field name still resolves).

Supported operators:
- Standard SQL: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE`
- `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` -- via `exists()` and `notExists()`
- `CONTAINS` -- translated to `LIKE '%escaped_value%'`
- `STARTS_WITH` -- translated to `LIKE 'escaped_value%'`

The `IN` operator coerces non-array values to a single-element array (`is_array($value) ? $value : [$value]`), making it safe to pass either a single value or an array.

LIKE wildcard escaping: `str_replace(['%', '_'], ['\\%', '\\_'], $value)` before wrapping with `%`.

Count mode: `count()` switches `execute()` to return `[(int) $count]` instead of IDs.

`accessCheck()` is a no-op in v0.1.0.

**Memoization**: When a `SqlEntityQueryResultCache` is provided, `execute()` fingerprints conditions, sorts, range, and count mode (`xxh128` of a normalized payload), stores `{entityTypeId, fingerprint} → result`, and returns cached ID lists or `[(int)count]` on hits. There is no cross-table invalidation: cache entries for a type are dropped only when that type’s `SqlEntityStorage` completes `save()` or `delete()` that performs a write.

Usage pattern:
```php
$ids = $storage->getQuery()
    ->condition('status', 1)
    ->condition('type', 'article')
    ->sort('created', 'DESC')
    ->range(0, 10)
    ->execute();

$entities = $storage->loadMultiple($ids);
```

## Events

### EntityEvent

File: `packages/entity/src/Event/EntityEvent.php`

```php
final class EntityEvent extends Event
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly EntityInterface $entity,
        public readonly ?EntityInterface $originalEntity = null,
    ) {}
}
```

Properties are **public readonly**. Access as `$event->entity` and `$event->originalEntity`. There are NO getter methods. Common mistake: `$event->getEntity()` does not exist.

### EntityEvents (enum)

File: `packages/entity/src/Event/EntityEvents.php`

```php
enum EntityEvents: string
{
    case PRE_SAVE = 'waaseyaa.entity.pre_save';
    case POST_SAVE = 'waaseyaa.entity.post_save';
    case PRE_DELETE = 'waaseyaa.entity.pre_delete';
    case POST_DELETE = 'waaseyaa.entity.post_delete';
    case POST_LOAD = 'waaseyaa.entity.post_load';
    case PRE_CREATE = 'waaseyaa.entity.pre_create';
    case REVISION_CREATED = 'waaseyaa.entity.revision_created';
    case REVISION_REVERTED = 'waaseyaa.entity.revision_reverted';
}
```

Dispatched with `$eventDispatcher->dispatch(new EntityEvent($entity), EntityEvents::PRE_SAVE->value)`.
Note: use `->value` to get the string from the enum.

### Domain Events (EntitySaved, EntityDeleted)

File: `packages/entity/src/Event/EntitySaved.php` -- extends `DomainEvent`, contains `$changedFields`, `$isNew`
File: `packages/entity/src/Event/EntityDeleted.php` -- extends `DomainEvent`

These are separate from `EntityEvent`. They carry aggregate metadata (`aggregateType`, `aggregateId`, `tenantId`, `actorId`).

### EntityEventFactoryInterface

File: `packages/entity/src/Event/EntityEventFactoryInterface.php`

```php
interface EntityEventFactoryInterface
{
    public function create(
        EntityInterface $entity,
        ?EntityInterface $originalEntity = null,
    ): EntityEvent;
}
```

`DefaultEntityEventFactory` (`packages/entity/src/Event/DefaultEntityEventFactory.php`) is the default implementation — simply returns `new EntityEvent($entity, $originalEntity)`. Applications can provide custom factories to attach additional context (e.g., tenant ID, actor ID) to entity events.

`EntityRepository` accepts `?EntityEventFactoryInterface` in its constructor (defaults to `DefaultEntityEventFactory`). `EntityStorageFactory` propagates the factory to storage instances.

### Entity Validation

File: `packages/entity/src/Validation/EntityValidator.php`

```php
final class EntityValidator
{
    public function __construct(private readonly ValidatorInterface $validator);

    public static function createDefault(): self;   // wraps Validation::createValidator(); stateless, shareable

    public function validate(EntityInterface $entity, array $constraints = []): ConstraintViolationListInterface;
}
```

**Kernel wiring (default-on since alpha.204, #1643).** `AbstractKernel` builds ONE shared `EntityValidator::createDefault()` at boot and passes it (`validator:`) to every `EntityRepository` its repository factory constructs. The decision is made once, at boot, from the environment: `WAASEYAA_ENTITY_VALIDATION` set to `0`, `false`, or `off` (case-insensitive) disables the wiring — repositories are then built without a validator, byte-identical to pre-alpha.204 behavior. Unset or any other value means enforcement ON. The per-call escape hatch `save($entity, validate: false)` / `saveMany($entities, validate: false)` is independent of the env switch and is the sanctioned bypass for writes that are invalid by design (migrations, schema bootstrap, fixture seeding).

**Pre-persistence guarantee.** When validation fails, `EntityValidationException` is thrown BEFORE any storage write — base table, bundle subtable, translation table, and revision table are all untouched; existing rows are unchanged. The exception's violation list is complete (all violations across all fields, not first-failure), and each violation exposes the field name via `propertyPath` (prefix = field name), a human-readable message, and the invalid value. For a given entity state and definition set the violation list content is deterministic across runs; consumers may rely on field-name presence, not list ordering, at this layer. **saveMany rollback:** a validation failure inside the `saveMany()` batch aborts the `UnitOfWork` transaction — entities saved earlier in the same batch are rolled back, and the thrown exception identifies the failing entity's violations. Entity types whose resolved constraint map is empty save with zero validation overhead beyond map resolution. (Mission contract: `kitty-specs/live-entity-validation-key-protection-01KTWQT3/contracts/validation-error.md`.)

Validates entity field values against per-field Symfony Validator constraints. `$constraints` is keyed by field name. Values are always read with `EntityInterface::get($field)` so Symfony sees **cast-aware domain types** when the entity defines `$casts` (e.g. `Type(BackedEnum::class)` constraints). Do not use `toArray()` slices here — storage scalars would bypass casts (#1181 ST-6). `FieldableInterface` adds field metadata only; `get()`/`set()` are part of the core `EntityInterface` contract. Violations are remapped to include the field path.

File: `packages/entity/src/Validation/EntityValidationException.php`

```php
final class EntityValidationException extends \RuntimeException
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly ConstraintViolationListInterface $violations,
        string $message = 'Entity validation failed.',
    );
}
```

Thrown by `EntityRepository::save()` when validation fails. The `$violations` property provides programmatic access to all constraint violations.

#### Field definitions → constraints (#1182, #1643)

For a field `F` on entity type `T`, three constraint sources compose with fixed precedence:

| Layer | Source | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Derived | Field settings → `FieldDefinitionConstraintBuilder` | required → NotBlank/NotNull; min/max_length → Length; email → Email; allowed_values/enum → Choice; scalar type → Type; numeric `min`/`max` settings → Range |
| 2. Declared per-field | `FieldDefinition::getConstraints()` (`Constraint[]`) | **Appended** after the derived list (tightens, never replaces); a non-`Constraint` entry throws `InvalidArgumentException` |
| 3. Manual per-type | `EntityType::getConstraints()` (field → constraints map) | **Replaces** layers 1+2 entirely for that field; manual-only fields are included, derived-only fields keep builder output |

File: `packages/entity/src/Validation/FieldDefinitionConstraintBuilder.php`

Maps `EntityType::getFieldDefinitions()` metadata to per-field Symfony `Constraint` lists (same key shape as `getConstraints()`) — layers 1 and 2 above. Supported keys on each field array:

| Metadata | Symfony constraints | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| `required` / `required: true` | `NotBlank` for string-like `type` (`string`, `email`, `text`, `slug`, default) | |
| `required` + `boolean` / `integer` / `entity_reference` / `timestamp` / `datetime`_* | `NotNull` | So `false` and `0` remain valid when a field is required. |
| `max_length` / `maxLength`, `min_length` / `minLength` | `Length` | Single constraint when either bound is set. |
| `type: email` | `Email` | In addition to string typing when applicable. |
| `allowed_values` / `allowedValues` | `Choice` | Non-empty list only. |
| `enum_class` / `enumClass` (`BackedEnum`) | `Choice` on backing values | PHP enum class name. |
| `type` scalar | `Type` | `bool`, `int`, `float`, `string` (incl. `email`/`text`/`slug`), `array`/`json`. Boolean fields accept only the canonical native PHP `bool` after definition-driven ingress normalization. Omitted for `entity_reference` and `timestamp` (storage shape varies). Integer fields with `settings.subtype: timestamp` use `AtLeastOneOf(Type(int), Type(DateTimeInterface))`, accepting both unix storage and cast-aware domain representations. |
| `min` / `max` settings on `integer` / `int` / `float` / `double` | `Range` | Derived when `min` and/or `max` is numeric — both, either, or neither may be present (mirrors the Length shape). (#1643) |

Per-field declared constraints (`FieldDefinition::getConstraints()`, object-shaped definitions; array-shaped definitions carry `constraints` through `normalizeDefinition()`) are appended after the derived list for the same field.

File: `packages/entity/src/Validation/EntityTypeValidationConstraints.php`

`EntityTypeValidationConstraints::forEntityType(EntityTypeInterface)` builds the map used by `EntityRepository::doSave()` when a validator is configured (the default — see “Kernel wiring” above):

1. Derive constraints from `getFieldDefinitions()` via `FieldDefinitionConstraintBuilder::build()` (layers 1+2).
2. Merge `getConstraints()`: **for each field name present in `getConstraints()`, the manual value replaces the derived list entirely** for that field (layer 3).

Opt-outs: boot-time `WAASEYAA_ENTITY_VALIDATION=0|false|off` builds repositories without a validator; per-call `EntityRepository::save($entity, validate: false)` (and `saveMany`) skips validation for that call. There is no separate flag for “manual only.”

Invalid data raises `EntityValidationException` with property paths equal to field names (plus nested paths when a constraint reports a sub-path), thrown before any storage write — see “Pre-persistence guarantee” above.

#### Entity fixture values for tests and seeds (#1186)

Files: `packages/testing/src/Factory/EntityTypeFixtureValues.php`, `packages/testing/src/Factory/EntityFactory.php` (`defineFromEntityType`).

**Purpose:** Generate **storage-shaped** value arrays for PHPUnit, in-memory fixtures, and app seed scripts (non-goal: framework CLI seed commands). Optional `fakerphp/faker` improves human-like strings/emails when installed; otherwise small deterministic defaults are used.

**Constraint source:** `EntityTypeFixtureValues::values()` uses the same merged map as persistence validation — `EntityTypeValidationConstraints::forEntityType()` (derived field definitions + manual `getConstraints()`, identical merge semantics to `EntityRepository::doSave()`). Generated samples are intended to satisfy `EntityValidator` for that map when values are loaded on an entity whose `get()` semantics match storage (no `$casts` surprises).

**Distinction vs production hydration (#1188):** Factories are **not** `HydratableFromStorageInterface` / `EntityInstantiator` / static `make()` rehydration. They synthesize dummy data from metadata; production paths merge **real** storage or API rows. A future domain `make()` may wrap a compatible value bag, but factories remain test/seed-only.

**API surface:** `EntityTypeFixtureValues` accepts a sequence index (for `Choice` cycling and uniqueness) and an optional per-field resolver: `callable(string $field, list<Constraint> $constraints): mixed|null` — return `null` to fall back to built-in generation for that field; use `values(..., $overrides)` for explicit nulls or replacements. `EntityType::getKeys()` triggers defaults for `uuid` (RFC 4122 via `symfony/uid`), `label`, `bundle`, and `langcode` when those mappings exist. `EntityFactory::defineFromEntityType()` registers those defaults so existing `sequence()` / `createMany()` usage keeps working.

**Extension:** Unknown Symfony `Constraint` subclasses are not synthesized — supply values via overrides or the custom resolver. Cast-heavy entities should keep fixtures storage-canonical (same rule as constructor values in #1181).

### Entity Lifecycle Hooks

File: `packages/entity/src/EntityBase.php`

`EntityBase` provides four no-op lifecycle hooks that subclasses can override:

```php
public function preSave(bool $isNew): void {}
public function postSave(bool $isNew): void {}
public function preDelete(): void {}
public function postDelete(): void {}
```

Called by `EntityRepository` (not `SqlEntityStorage`). Execution order within `save()`:

```
preSave($isNew) → PRE_SAVE event → persist → POST_SAVE event → postSave($isNew)
```

Execution order within `delete()`:

```
preDelete() → PRE_DELETE event → remove → POST_DELETE event → postDelete()
```

Hooks are only called when the entity is an instance of `EntityBase`. They run inside `UnitOfWork` transactions for batch operations (`saveMany`/`deleteMany`).

## Configuration Entities

### ConfigEntityBase

File: `packages/entity/src/ConfigEntityBase.php`
Class: `abstract class ConfigEntityBase extends EntityBase implements ConfigEntityInterface`

Config entities differ from content entities:
- Stored as YAML via config system, not in SQL tables
- Have `status()` (enabled/disabled) and `getDependencies()`
- `toConfig()` returns array suitable for YAML serialization
- Dependencies keyed by type: `['package' => [...], 'config' => [...], 'content' => [...]]`

## Config System (packages/config/src/)

### ConfigInterface

File: `packages/config/src/ConfigInterface.php`

```php
interface ConfigInterface
{
    public function getName(): string;
    public function get(string $key = ''): mixed;      // dot-notation traversal
    public function set(string $key, mixed $value): static;
    public function clear(string $key): static;
    public function delete(): static;
    public function save(): static;
    public function isNew(): bool;
    public function getRawData(): array;
}
```

### Config

File: `packages/config/src/Config.php`
Class: `final class Config implements ConfigInterface`

Supports dot-notation for nested values: `$config->get('page.front')`.
Mutable vs immutable: constructor accepts `bool $immutable`. Immutable configs throw `ImmutableConfigException` on any write operation.

### ConfigFactoryInterface

File: `packages/config/src/ConfigFactoryInterface.php`

```php
interface ConfigFactoryInterface
{
    public function get(string $name): ConfigInterface;           // returns immutable
    public function getEditable(string $name): ConfigInterface;   // returns mutable
    public function loadMultiple(array $names): array;
    public function rename(string $oldName, string $newName): static;
    public function listAll(string $prefix = ''): array;
}
```

`get()` returns cached immutable Config. `getEditable()` always creates a new mutable Config wrapped in EventAwareStorage.

**Production binding:** `Waaseyaa\Config\ConfigServiceProvider` (`packages/config/src/ConfigServiceProvider.php`, declared in `packages/config/composer.json`'s `extra.waaseyaa.providers`) binds `ConfigFactoryInterface` as a container singleton, backed by `FileStorage` pointed at `<projectRoot>/config/active` — the same active store `Waaseyaa\CLI\Provider\OptimizeServiceProvider` compiles for `optimize:config`; there is exactly one active store, not a second instance. Before this provider existed, no production ServiceProvider bound the interface at all, so any consumer resolving it via `resolveOptional(ConfigFactoryInterface::class)` (e.g. `Waaseyaa\SSR\ThemeServiceProvider`) silently received `null` and no-opped in a real boot (#1920 WP-1 follow-up).

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-06 - fix(#1920): bind ConfigFactoryInterface in production boot -->

### ConfigManagerInterface

File: `packages/config/src/ConfigManagerInterface.php`

```php
interface ConfigManagerInterface
{
    public function getActiveStorage(): StorageInterface;
    public function getSyncStorage(): StorageInterface;
    public function import(): ConfigImportResult;
    public function export(): void;
    public function diff(string $configName): array;
}
```

`import()` compares sync to active storage, creates/updates/deletes as needed, returns `ConfigImportResult`.
`export()` clears sync storage, copies all active configs.

`ConfigManager` dispatches `ConfigEvents::IMPORT` through `Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface`. Callers may provide either the concrete Symfony dispatcher or any contracts-compatible dispatcher implementation; the manager only relies on `dispatch()`.

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-06 - audit R16/#1915 fix (#1925): `import()` used to collect every create/update/delete failure into `ConfigImportResult::$errors` and keep applying the rest of the batch (fail-open per-item). A write/delete failure now instead throws `Waaseyaa\Config\Exception\ConfigImportFailedException` and aborts the pass immediately — the exception names the failed key and reports what had already been applied (created/updated/deleted so far) so the operator gets a precise, actionable stop rather than a silently partial import. A **read** failure on the sync side is unchanged (still collected into `$errors`, import continues) because nothing was partially applied for that entry. `ConfigManagerInterface::import()` gained a `@throws ConfigImportFailedException` docblock; `config:import` (`ConfigImportHandler`) catches it and reports via `$io->error()` with a nonzero exit, same shape as the pre-existing errors-array reporting path. Companion fix: `FileStorage::write()` now writes to a writer-unique temp file (`<target>.tmp<uniqid>`) in the same directory and `rename()`s it into place, so a crash mid-write can no longer leave a truncated config file visible at the real path (write-to-temp-then-rename, the same pattern `docs/specs/infrastructure.md`'s cache-file recovery guidance describes). Public `StorageInterface::write()` contract (bool return) unchanged. -->

### Config StorageInterface

File: `packages/config/src/StorageInterface.php`

```php
interface StorageInterface
{
    public function exists(string $name): bool;
    public function read(string $name): array|false;
    public function readMultiple(array $names): array;
    public function write(string $name, array $data): bool;
    public function delete(string $name): bool;
    public function rename(string $name, string $newName): bool;
    public function listAll(string $prefix = ''): array;
    public function deleteAll(string $prefix = ''): bool;
    public function createCollection(string $collection): static;
    public function getCollectionName(): string;
    public function getAllCollectionNames(): array;
}
```

Implementations: `Storage\MemoryStorage`, `Storage\FileStorage`.

### Config Events

File: `packages/config/src/Event/ConfigEvents.php`

```php
enum ConfigEvents: string
{
    case PRE_SAVE = 'waaseyaa.config.pre_save';
    case POST_SAVE = 'waaseyaa.config.post_save';
    case PRE_DELETE = 'waaseyaa.config.pre_delete';
    case POST_DELETE = 'waaseyaa.config.post_delete';
    case IMPORT = 'waaseyaa.config.import';
}
```

## Field System (packages/field/src/)

### FieldTypeInterface

File: `packages/field/src/FieldTypeInterface.php`

```php
interface FieldTypeInterface extends PluginInspectionInterface
{
    public static function schema(): array;           // array<string, array{type: string, ...}>
    public static function defaultSettings(): array;
    public static function defaultValue(): mixed;
    public static function jsonSchema(): array;
}
```

### FieldDefinition

File: `packages/field/src/FieldDefinition.php`
Class: `final readonly class FieldDefinition implements FieldDefinitionInterface`

```php
public function __construct(
    private string $name,
    private string $type,
    private int $cardinality = 1,
    private array $settings = [],
    private string $targetEntityTypeId = '',
    private ?string $targetBundle = null,  // see bundle-scoped-fields.md
    private bool $translatable = false,
    private bool $revisionable = false,
    private mixed $defaultValue = null,
    private string $label = '',
    private string $description = '',
    private bool $required = false,
    private bool $readOnly = false,
    private array $constraints = [],    // Constraint[]
    private FieldStorage $stored = FieldStorage::Column,  // see "Storage hint" below
)
```

`toJsonSchema()` maps types: `string` -> `{'type': 'string'}`, `integer` -> `{'type': 'integer'}`, `boolean` -> `{'type': 'boolean'}`, `float` -> `{'type': 'number'}`, `text` -> object with `value`/`format`, `entity_reference` -> object with `target_id`/`target_type`. Wraps in `{'type': 'array', 'items': ...}` when `isMultiple()`.

**Storage hint.** `FieldStorage` (`packages/field/src/FieldStorage.php`, backed enum: `Column`, `Data`) tells the schema and storage layers where the field's canonical value lives:

- `FieldStorage::Column` (default) — `SqlSchemaHandler` materializes a column for the field; `SqlEntityStorage::splitForStorage()` writes the value to that column; `SqlEntityQuery` resolves it as a base/subtable column reference.
- `FieldStorage::Data` — `SqlSchemaHandler` skips column emission (both base and bundle-subtable specs); `SqlEntityStorage::splitForStorage()` routes the value into the `_data` JSON blob even when a legacy column happens to exist; `SqlEntityQuery::routeFields()` accepts the registered field as core and `resolveField()` consults the same registry hint via `getDataStoredCoreFieldNames()` and resolves to `json_extract(_data, '$.field')` directly — the legacy column, if present, is never read (mission #1257 WP04, K2).

Core `EntityType::fieldDefinitions` metadata may pass `'stored' => FieldStorage::Data` (or the string `'data'`); `FieldDefinitionRegistry::synthesizeCoreField()` reads the value into the `FieldDefinition`. The hint enables registry-aware queries like `getQuery()->condition('status', 1)` to resolve cleanly without forcing a dedicated column for low-traffic universals.

### FieldItemBase

File: `packages/field/src/FieldItemBase.php`
Class: `abstract class FieldItemBase extends PluginBase implements FieldItemInterface, FieldTypeInterface`

Subclasses must implement:
- `static function propertyDefinitions(): array` -- e.g., `['value' => 'string']`
- `static function mainPropertyName(): string` -- e.g., `'value'`
- `static function schema(): array` -- SQL column definitions
- `static function jsonSchema(): array` -- JSON Schema representation

### Built-in Field Items

| Class | Path | ID | Properties | Main Property |
|-------|------|----|------------|---------------|
| `StringItem` | `packages/field/src/Item/StringItem.php` | `string` | `value: string` | `value` |
| `TextItem` | `packages/field/src/Item/TextItem.php` | `text` | `value: string, format: string` | `value` |
| `IntegerItem` | `packages/field/src/Item/IntegerItem.php` | `integer` | `value: integer` | `value` |
| `FloatItem` | `packages/field/src/Item/FloatItem.php` | `float` | `value: float` | `value` |
| `BooleanItem` | `packages/field/src/Item/BooleanItem.php` | `boolean` | `value: boolean` | `value` |
| `EntityReferenceItem` | `packages/field/src/Item/EntityReferenceItem.php` | `entity_reference` | `target_id: integer, target_type: string` | `target_id` |

### FieldItemList

File: `packages/field/src/FieldItemList.php`
Class: `class FieldItemList implements FieldItemListInterface, \IteratorAggregate, \Countable`

Contains `FieldItemInterface[]` items. Supports `__get($name)` to access first item's property value (e.g., `$list->value`).

**Not wired into the entity value path:** entity field values flow through `EntityBase::get()`/`set()` over the `$values` bag (plus optional `ValueCaster`), **not** through `FieldItemList`. The object layer (`FieldItemList`, `FieldItemBase` and subclasses) is `@api` forward-scaffolding; only the **static** facet of `FieldItemBase` (`defaultSettings()`/`schema()`/`schemaFor()`/`jsonSchemaFor()`) is live, consumed by `FieldTypeManager` for storage + JSON-Schema generation. No production code constructs a `FieldItemList`/`FieldItemBase` instance; object-layer integration into the value path is future work.

### FieldTypeManager

File: `packages/field/src/FieldTypeManager.php`
Class: `final class FieldTypeManager extends DefaultPluginManager implements FieldTypeManagerInterface`

Constructor: `(array $directories = [], ?CacheBackendInterface $cache = null)`

Uses `AttributeDiscovery` with `FieldType::class` attribute. Plugin discovery scans directories for `#[FieldType(...)]` attributes.

Additional methods:
- `getDefaultSettings(string $fieldType): array`
- `getColumns(string $fieldType): array` -- returns `schema()` from the field type class

### FieldType Attribute

File: `packages/field/src/Attribute/FieldType.php`

```php
#[\Attribute(\Attribute::TARGET_CLASS)]
final class FieldType extends WaaseyaaPlugin
{
    public function __construct(
        string $id,
        string $label = '',
        string $description = '',
        string $package = '',
        public readonly string $category = 'general',
        public readonly int $defaultCardinality = 1,
        public readonly string $defaultWidget = '',
        public readonly string $defaultFormatter = '',
    )
}
```

## Field templates and the bundle registry

Bundle-scoped field definitions can be declared declaratively using PHP attributes on template classes, then compiled into the `FieldDefinitionRegistry` at boot time.

### Attributes

**`#[BundleTemplate(entityType: string, bundle: string)]`** (class-level) — marks a class as a template for the given `(entityType, bundle)` pair.

**`#[FieldTemplate(key: string, type: string, label?: string, group?: string, promptAliases?: list<string>, required?: bool, readOnly?: bool)]`** (property or method) — declares one field. Properties are processed before methods, both in declaration order.

### FieldDefinition extensions (mission `single-entity-work-surface-01KQ7M1P`)

`FieldDefinition` gained two trailing optional constructor parameters:
- `string $group = ''` — logical grouping key (e.g. `'identity'`, `'about'`). Consumed by `FormDescriptorBuilder` to emit `FormFieldDescriptor::$group`.
- `array $promptAliases = []` — normalized synonyms for AI / structured-import matching. Consumed by `GfmTableImporter`. Uniqueness (normalized UTF-8 lowercase + whitespace collapse) is enforced at compile time.

`FieldDefinitionInterface` correspondingly gained `getGroup(): string` and `getPromptAliases(): array`.

### BundleTemplateCompiler

`Waaseyaa\Field\BundleTemplateCompiler` accepts an explicit list of class names and registers the resulting `FieldDefinition` objects with `FieldDefinitionRegistry::registerBundleFields()`. Compilation is idempotent — subsequent calls are no-ops.

```php
$compiler = new BundleTemplateCompiler($fieldDefinitionRegistry);
$compiler->compile([ProfileTemplate::class, ArticleTemplate::class]);
```

Duplicate field keys or duplicate normalized prompt aliases within the same bundle throw `\InvalidArgumentException`.

→ See `docs/specs/work-surface.md` F2 for usage and `docs/specs/bundle-scoped-fields.md` for the full bundle-scoped field contract.

## Field storage backends (mission `entity-storage-v2-01KRCDDC`)

The entity storage layer supports multiple pluggable field storage backends under
the `waaseyaa/entity-storage` package. This section documents the multi-backend
architecture introduced by that mission.

### Overview

Prior to this mission, all field values were stored in a single `_data` JSON blob
column alongside entity-key columns. The multi-backend architecture allows each
`FieldDefinition` to declare which backend stores its values. Two built-in
backends are provided:

| Backend id   | Class                 | Storage strategy                              |
|------------- |---------------------- |---------------------------------------------- |
| `sql-blob`   | `SqlBlobBackend`      | JSON `_data` blob; all fields in one column   |
| `sql-column` | `SqlColumnBackend`    | Dedicated SQL column per field                |

### FieldStorageBackendV2Interface

Every backend implements the active, fingerprinted V2 contract:

```php
interface FieldStorageBackendV2Interface
{
    public function id(): string;
    public function fingerprint(): string;
    public function invoke(FieldStorageGatewayRole $gateway, FieldStorageGatewayInput $input): FieldStorageGatewayOutput;
}
```

The fingerprint is a frozen lowercase SHA-256 value. Inputs, outputs, roles,
invocations, and receipts are opaque, non-serializable, and exact-boundary
objects. Backends unwrap and complete each call through the registrar-issued
role; raw implementations are never exposed.

### Backend registration

Backends are registered via `BackendRegistrar`. Providers implement
`HasFieldStorageBackendsV2Interface` and return instances from
`fieldStorageBackendsV2()`. `BackendRegistrarFactory` creates the registrar;
active construction requires a strict gateway audit binding.

`IsFrameworkBackendProviderV2Interface` is reserved for built-in providers and
permits use of reserved backend ids only when the provider is also in the
composition root's explicit framework allowlist.

`ReservedBackendIds` holds the canonical string constants for the two built-in
backends: `SQL_BLOB = 'sql-blob'` and `SQL_COLUMN = 'sql-column'`.

#### `FieldStorage::Data` under `sql-column`: the hint follows the physical shape (#2165)

`FieldStorage::Data` says where a value *should* live. It does not say where it
*does*, and on `sql-column` the two differ: `EntitySchemaSync` selects
entity-level fields by **backend**, so it materialises a real column for every
declared field and creates no `_data` blob at all.

Both storage sides now resolve the hint against the physical shape rather than
against the hint alone:

- `SqlStorageDriver::splitForWrite()` routes a Data-declared value to `_data`
  **only when a `_data` column exists**; otherwise it writes to the column that
  was created for it.
- `SqlEntityQuery::resolveField()` emits `json_extract(<table>._data, …)` under
  the same condition, so a filter or sort on a Data-declared field works on
  `sql-column` instead of querying a column that is not there.

Before #2165 the write half honoured the hint unconditionally and flushed its
JSON bucket only `if ($hasDataColumn)` — so on a blob-less table the bucket was
**silently discarded**. `save()` returned success, nothing was logged, and the
column stayed `NULL`. The read path was never broken, which made the symptom
look like a lost reload rather than a write that never happened.

Anything genuinely unstorable now raises `UnstorableFieldException` rather than
vanishing: a value with no column *and* no blob, or a non-scalar bound for a
column this driver cannot encode and reload faithfully.

`splitForWrite()` has a single caller, so create, update and revision writes
inherit this from one boundary. When adding a storage path, resolve `stored:`
against the table's real shape — a `_data` column is a property of the backend,
not of the field.

#### Backend registration is what makes any of this work (#2160)

`AbstractKernel::validateQueryDefinitions()` builds a `BackendRegistrar` from
`$manifest->providers`, keeping only classes implementing
`HasFieldStorageBackendsV2Interface`. **`FrameworkFieldStorageBackendProvider`
(`packages/entity-storage`) is the class that registers `sql-blob` and
`sql-column`**, declared through the ordinary `extra.waaseyaa.providers` key. It
implements `IsFrameworkBackendProviderV2Interface`, without which
`BackendRegistrar::registerV2()` rejects both ids as reserved ids claimed by a
third party.

Before #2160 that provider did not exist and nothing else implemented the
interface, so the registrar was **empty in every application**. Nothing noticed,
because `DefinitionValidator::validateType()` skips every field that is not
`isIndexed()` and `BackendResolver::resolve()` — the registrar's only live
consumer — is reached only for indexed fields. #2157 made `indexed: true`
declarable, and the first application to use it aborted `db:init` with
`UnknownBackendException`, naming `sql-blob` just as readily as `sql-column`.

**Registered instances are query-support only.** `BackendRegistrar` constructs
providers with `new $fqcn()` and keys gateways by backend id alone, so a
registered backend is global and cannot carry the table name, id key or entity
type id that read/write/delete need. Both backends therefore expose
`forQuerySupport()` for that role, and IO through a registry-obtained gateway
throws rather than issuing SQL against an empty table name. Per-entity-type
instances are constructed directly, with a real database, by the storage layer
that knows the table.

When adding a new backend, register it from a provider the manifest discovers;
do not construct a registrar by hand. A test that constructs `EntitySchemaSync`
directly bypasses this entire path — which is exactly how #2160 shipped.

#### Selecting a backend from the attribute (#2157)

`#[ContentEntityType(storageBackend: PrimaryStorageBackend::SQL_COLUMN)]`
selects the primary storage backend for an attribute-defined content entity
type, and `#[Field(indexed: true)]` requests a physical B-tree index on a
materialised column. Both flow through `EntityMetadataReader` and
`EntityType::fromClass()`; the `@internal` `_fieldDefinitions` constructor slot
is NOT involved and remains reserved for the factory.

`Waaseyaa\Entity\Storage\PrimaryStorageBackend` holds the ids usable from the
attribute. It deliberately MIRRORS `ReservedBackendIds` rather than importing
it, because `packages/entity` must not depend on `packages/entity-storage`; the
two are pinned together by a test in entity-storage, which can see both.

**Omitting `storageBackend` preserves the historical default exactly.** Every
entity type that does not declare one resolves to `sql-blob`, with non-key
fields in `_data`, unchanged.

#### Three properties that are easy to conflate

| Property | Determined by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Queryable / filterable** | the field's declared `FieldStorage` | What Listing Rule G checks. A blob-backed field can still be filtered and sorted through the backend's query support. This is the default and stays fully supported |
| **Physically materialised** | the ENTITY TYPE's primary storage backend | Only `sql-column` creates real columns. A field declared `FieldStorage::Column` on a `sql-blob` type passes Rule G and still lives in `_data` |
| **Physically indexed** | `indexed: true` **and** the `sql-column` backend | Declaring an index the backend cannot create raises `UnmaterializableIndexException` at schema-sync time |

Declaring `FieldStorage::Column` alone has never guaranteed a database column,
and Rule G has never promised one. Before #2157 that divergence was silent;
`indexed: true` now makes the intent explicit and the unmaterializable case loud.

#### `indexed: true` requires `FieldStorage::Column` — as a contract, not a physics claim

`#[Field]` rejects `indexed: true` alongside `FieldStorage::Data` at
construction. State the reason precisely, because the obvious justification is
wrong:

- `indexed: true` is contractually permitted **only** with
  `stored: FieldStorage::Column`.
- The rule exists so that requesting an index is always an explicit declaration
  of indexable intent, on a field the developer has also declared column-shaped.
- A `Data` declaration is therefore non-indexable **by API contract**, even
  though the current `sql-column` backend does in fact materialise a column for
  it (see the note immediately below).
- That backend behaviour is pre-existing and may change. The attribute API does
  not promise it either way, which is precisely why the contract is stated in
  terms of the declaration rather than in terms of what the storage layer
  happens to do today.

Do **not** describe the combination as physically impossible. Under `sql-column`
the column exists.

**Note on `FieldStorage::Data` under `sql-column`.** `EntitySchemaSync` selects
entity-level fields by backend rather than per-field `stored`, so on a
`sql-column` type ALL declared fields are materialised as columns and no `_data`
blob is created. `FieldStorage::Data` therefore has no effect on that backend.
This is pre-existing behaviour, pinned by
`AttributeSelectedColumnBackendTest::on_the_column_backend_every_declared_field_is_materialised_and_there_is_no_blob`,
and is a candidate for a follow-up rather than part of #2157.

The registrar returns only `FieldStorageBackendGateway`; it has no raw backend
accessor. Each operation reserves a value-free descriptor before fingerprint
validation or invocation and finalizes success or failure durably. Preflight
may validate fingerprints without issuing gateway authority. There is no V1
interface, provider marker, adapter, conformance harness, or fallback.

### EntityStorageCoordinator

`EntityStorageCoordinator` is the fan-out engine. On save, it dispatches
`BeforeSaveEvent`, captures post-callback persistence values through a private
closed authority, then invokes each registrar-owned gateway in registration
order. The raw value bag is never passed to an event, provider, or backend.
Delete similarly invokes each gateway before `AfterDeleteEvent`.

`BackendResolver` resolves which backend is responsible for a given
`FieldDefinition` (consulting `FieldDefinition::getBackendId()` or falling back
to the entity type's primary storage backend).

`UnknownBackendException` is thrown when a field references a backend id that is
not registered.

### Lifecycle events (WP04)

The coordinator dispatches four lifecycle events:

| Event class             | When dispatched                                      |
|------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------- |
| `BeforeSaveEvent`       | Before any backend write; listener may abort via `AbortOperationException` |
| `AfterSaveEvent`        | After all backends commit; NOT dispatched on partial failure |
| `BeforeDeleteEvent`     | Before any backend delete; listener may abort        |
| `AfterDeleteEvent`      | After all backends confirm delete                    |

All four implement `EntityLifecycleEventInterface`.

`PartialSaveException` is thrown on a backend fan-out failure, including a first
backend failure with an empty committed set. Its `$errorCode` property (not `$code` — see upgrade guide §1.4 note)
carries a `string` diagnostic code. `SaveContext` is an immutable value object
passed to save operations; it carries revision flags. `CoordinatorLifecycleDispatcher`
dispatches these events from the coordinator.

V2 gateway audit is strict and begins before backend invocation: reservation or
fingerprint failure performs no backend call and begins no write. After
invocation starts, the coordinator/backends remain nontransactional. A failing
backend may have performed an internal write, and earlier backends remain in
the committed set; no automatic rollback is attempted. Failure audit records
whether invocation began, while `PartialSaveException` remains the caller's
committed/uncommitted reconciliation contract.

`AbortOperationException` is thrown by event listeners to abort the operation
before any backend is written.

### sql-blob backend

`SqlBlobBackend` stores all field values as JSON in a `_data` TEXT column on the
entity table. Fields explicitly marked `FieldStorage::Data` always go to `_data`.
`supportsQuery()` returns `false` for all field types — the blob backend delegates
queries to the column-equality path in `SqlEntityStorage`.

### sql-column backend

`SqlColumnBackend` stores each field in its own SQL column. Schema management is
handled by `SqlColumnSchemaBuilder`. Query translation is handled by
`SqlColumnQueryTranslator`. `TypeMapping` maps `FieldDefinition` type strings to
DBAL column type names. `supportsQuery()` returns `true` for all non-vector field
types (FR-014, FR-015).

### Definition validation

`DefinitionValidator` (in `Waaseyaa\EntityStorage\Query`) enforces FR-021's
fail-fast contract at kernel boot time. `AbstractKernel::validateQueryDefinitions()`
calls `validateAll()` after all service providers have registered their entity
types and before the booted flag is set. It throws `UnsupportedQueryException`
when any indexed field's resolved backend reports `supportsQuery()` = `false`.
Boot fails immediately — there is no silent fallback and no runtime retry.

### Revisionable entities (WP07–WP09)

Entity types that opt in to revisioning declare `isRevisionable(): true` and set
a `getPrimaryStorageBackend()` in their `EntityType`. The entity class implements
`RevisionableEntityInterface` (in `waaseyaa/entity`) and may use the
`RevisionableEntityTrait` mixin. `RevisionMetadata` is an immutable value object
carrying revision id, author, timestamp, and log message. `RevisionTableBuilder`
creates the `{entity_type}_revision` table.

The legacy `vid`-keyed revisionable storage stack — `RevisionableSqlBlobStorage`,
`RevisionableSqlColumnStorage`, `RevisionableEntityStorageInterface`, and
`RevisionPruner` — was **removed in alpha.196**. See
`docs/specs/revision-system-unified.md` for the current revisionable storage
model. `RevisionAccessRouter` (in `waaseyaa/access`) maps
`GateInterface::VIEW_REVISION` operations to the revision access policy.

### Storage migration CLI (WP10)

`MakeStorageMigrationHandler` and `MakeStorageMigrationServiceProvider` (in
`waaseyaa/cli`) wire the `make:storage-migration` command. `StorageMigrationEmitter`
generates PHP migration files from a `StorageMigrationTemplate`. `BackfillHelper`
populates new columns from existing `_data` blob values. `UnmappedFieldTypeException`
is thrown when a field type has no column mapping. `BackfillRowCountMismatchException`
is thrown when the backfill row count differs from the expected count.

type-mapping table.

## Implementation gotchas

- **In-memory test storage** lives at `Waaseyaa\Api\Tests\Fixtures\InMemoryEntityStorage`. Use it for unit tests; use `DBALDatabase::createSqlite()` for integration tests that exercise SQL behavior.
- **`EntityTypeManager` constructor signature**: `(EventDispatcherInterface, ?\Closure $storageFactory = null)`. The factory receives `EntityTypeInterface $definition`.
- **Entity types without a `uuid` key are config entities**: `SqlEntityStorage::save()` requires explicit non-empty string IDs for entities whose `EntityType` keys lack `'uuid' => 'uuid'`. Content entities with auto-increment IDs must include the `uuid` key even if they don't use UUIDs.
- **`entity_reference` field definitions need `target_entity_type_id`**: `EntityTypeBuilder` looks for `target_entity_type_id` or `targetEntityTypeId`, not `target`. Wrong key causes silent fallback to String type with no reference resolution.
- **`EntityBase` lifecycle hooks**: `preSave(bool $isNew)`, `postSave(bool $isNew)`, `preDelete()`, `postDelete()` are no-op by default. Override in subclasses. Order: `preSave()` → PRE_SAVE event → persist → POST_SAVE event → `postSave()`.
- **`EntityRepository` auto-validation**: An `EntityValidator` is injected by default into every kernel-built repository (alpha.204, #1643) — `save()` validates against the merged three-layer constraint map (`EntityTypeValidationConstraints::forEntityType()`) and throws `EntityValidationException` before any storage write. Pass `validate: false` to bypass for migrations/bulk imports (`saveMany()` also respects this), or set `WAASEYAA_ENTITY_VALIDATION=0|false|off` to disable the kernel wiring globally at boot.
- **`saveMany()`/`deleteMany()` use UnitOfWork**: Batch operations wrap all writes in a single transaction. Events are buffered and dispatched only after successful commit. Requires `$database` to be non-null (throws `LogicException` otherwise).
- **`_data` JSON blob**: `SqlSchemaHandler` adds a `_data` TEXT column. `SqlEntityStorage::splitForStorage()` puts non-schema values into it as JSON; `mapRowToEntity()` merges them back on load. Adding fields to an entity that aren't declared as columns means they live in `_data` and won't be queryable in SQL.
- **`EntityEvent` uses public properties**: `$event->entity` and `$event->originalEntity` are public readonly — no getter methods. Common mistake: `$event->getEntity()`.
