# Broadcasting (Server-Sent Events)

This spec documents Waaseyaa's production broadcasting subsystem: how domain events
fan out to long-lived SSE consumers (admin SPA, ops dashboards) without coupling
the request handler to subscriber bookkeeping.

The subsystem is intentionally narrow: in-process publishers push rows into a
durable SQL log; a single SSE endpoint polls the log on behalf of each
connected client. There is no in-memory pub/sub fan-out and no out-of-process
transport. Cross-process or cross-server delivery is out of scope.

## Pieces

| Component | Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `BroadcastStorage` | `packages/api/src/Controller/BroadcastStorage.php` | Durable message log backed by SQLite/MySQL via DBAL. Owns the `_broadcast_log` table; exposes `push`, `poll`, `prune`. |
| `EventListenerRegistrar::registerBroadcastListeners` | `packages/foundation/src/Kernel/EventListenerRegistrar.php` | Wires Symfony EventDispatcher listeners for `waaseyaa.entity.post_save` and `waaseyaa.entity.post_delete` → `BroadcastStorage::push`. |
| `BroadcastRouter` | `packages/foundation/src/Http/Router/BroadcastRouter.php` | `DomainRouterInterface` implementation. Reads `BroadcastStorage` from `WaaseyaaContext`, emits SSE frames via `StreamedResponse` until `connection_aborted()` returns 1. |
| `WaaseyaaContext::broadcastStorage` | `packages/foundation/src/Http/Router/WaaseyaaContext.php` | Per-request handle the kernel attaches to `$request->attributes['_broadcast_storage']`. |

## Data flow

```
Domain event (entity post_save / post_delete)
    ↓ Symfony EventDispatcher
EventListenerRegistrar listener
    ↓ BroadcastStorage::push(channel, event, data)
SQL table _broadcast_log (id, channel, event, data, created_at)
    ↑ BroadcastStorage::poll(cursor, channels[])
BroadcastRouter::handle (StreamedResponse loop)
    ↓ "event: <name>\ndata: <json>\n\n"
HTTP client (EventSource)
```

The router loop runs until `connection_aborted() === 1`, polling every 500ms
and emitting `: keepalive\n\n` every 15 seconds.

## `_broadcast_log` schema

Created idempotently by `BroadcastStorage::ensureTable()`:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | SSE cursor |
| `channel` | TEXT NOT NULL | Listener-chosen routing key (e.g. `'admin'`) |
| `event` | TEXT NOT NULL | Event name (e.g. `'entity.saved'`) |
| `data` | TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}' | JSON payload |
| `created_at` | REAL NOT NULL | `microtime(true)` |

This is a non-entity table (a message queue), so it lives outside the entity
storage pipeline per `.claude/rules/entity-storage-invariant.md`. Pruning is
automatic via `BroadcastStorageScheduleEntries` (see "Scheduled Pruning" below).

## Scheduled Pruning

`_broadcast_log` is pruned automatically by `BroadcastStorageScheduleEntries`, which is
auto-discovered at kernel boot via `ScheduleEntriesInterface`.

### Default schedule

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Cron | `0 2 * * *` (02:00 UTC nightly) |
| Retention window | 7 days (rows older than 7 days are deleted) |
| Config key | `schedule.broadcast_log_retention_days` (integer) |
| Task identity | `broadcast_log_prune` |

### Customizing retention

Set `schedule.broadcast_log_retention_days` in your configuration:

```yaml
schedule:
  broadcast_log_retention_days: 14  # keep 14 days of broadcast log history
```

### Disabling the prune task

Add the class FQCN to `schedule.disabled_entries`:

```yaml
schedule:
  disabled_entries:
    - Waaseyaa\Api\Schedule\BroadcastStorageScheduleEntries
```

When disabled, the entry appears as `[disabled]` in `bin/waaseyaa schedule:list` output
and `prune()` is never called — the table grows without bound. Disable only if you manage
pruning externally (e.g. via a custom database maintenance job).

### Background

Issue #1536 documented 243 rows accumulating in Minoo's local DB from 2026-03 testing.
The fix (`BroadcastStorageScheduleEntries`, scheduler-entry-auto-discovery mission) adds
auto-discovered pruning so consumers never need to wire the prune task manually.

## Endpoint

`GET /broadcast` — matched when `_controller == 'broadcast'` in the route
attributes. Query parameter `channels` is a comma-separated list. If absent or
empty, the router defaults to the `admin` channel.

Response headers:

```
Content-Type: text/event-stream
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: keep-alive
X-Accel-Buffering: no
```

The opening frame is a `connected` event with the resolved channel list. After
that, each `BroadcastStorage::poll` row is emitted as
`event: <event>\ndata: <full row json>\n\n`. Polling errors log via the
foundation logger and emit an `error` SSE event before pausing 5 seconds and
retrying.

## Built-in publishers

Two listeners ship in `EventListenerRegistrar::registerBroadcastListeners`:

| Event | Channel | Event name | Data |
|---|---|---|---|
| `waaseyaa.entity.post_save` | `admin` | `entity.saved` | `{entityType, id}` |
| `waaseyaa.entity.post_delete` | `admin` | `entity.deleted` | `{entityType, id}` |

Both wrap the push in try/catch and log on failure — broadcasting is best-effort
and must never break a write.

## Adding a publisher

To broadcast a new event:

1. Resolve `BroadcastStorage` from the request (`WaaseyaaContext::broadcastStorage`)
   in HTTP code, or obtain it through DI in long-running code (the kernel constructs
   one per HTTP request; non-HTTP contexts do not currently have a singleton).
2. Call `$broadcastStorage->push($channel, $event, $data)` from a Symfony
   `EventDispatcher` listener, controller, or service. Wrap in try/catch.
3. Choose a channel name that's stable for the subscriber side. The admin SPA
   subscribes to `admin` by default; new dashboards should pick their own.

Out-of-process publishers (queue workers, CLI commands) can write rows
directly via DBAL — the schema is owned by `BroadcastStorage::ensureTable` but
the table itself is a normal SQL table once created.

## Adding a subscriber

Open an `EventSource` to `/broadcast?channels=<csv>` from any authenticated
HTTP client. Each row arrives as a JSON-encoded `MessageEvent` whose `event`
field is the row's event name. The connection survives until either side
closes; the server-side loop terminates when `connection_aborted()` returns 1.

## Constraints

- Single-process: there is no Redis, NATS, or other cross-process transport.
  Multi-worker PHP-FPM deployments share the SQL store but each worker holds
  its own SSE connection.
- Polling: the router polls every 500ms; latency is bounded above by that
  interval, not by event arrival.
- No replay: clients receive only messages with `id > cursor`. There is no
  durable cursor per client — reconnects start fresh from "now."
- No per-channel ACLs: routing is by string name, not capability. Any
  authenticated session can subscribe to any channel.
- Authentication: the `/broadcast` route inherits the kernel's session
  middleware; an anonymous request returns the same redirect / 401 as any
  other authenticated route.

## Removed in 2026-05-18

The orphaned in-memory scaffold — `BroadcasterInterface`, `BroadcastMessage`,
`SseBroadcaster`, and `BroadcastController` — was deleted in favor of the
production `BroadcastStorage` path. The two paths had diverged: the in-memory
broadcaster supported a closure-based subscriber registry but was never wired
into the kernel and emitted nothing. `BroadcastRouter` had always used
`BroadcastStorage`. The deletion dropped five `SseBroadcaster` entries from the
PHPStan dead-code baseline. See PR closing #1497.
