# Security Defaults
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-09-05 - #2637: document that mcp.transport.max_request_bytes defaults to the same 1 MiB as http_security.body_size_limit.max_bytes and cannot be raised above an enabled kernel ceiling; BodySizeLimitMiddleware still runs first on MCP routes. -->
<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-26 - #2490 reconciles the documented HTTP boundary with runtime: HttpKernel now activates durable shared-database rate limiting and the request body-size limit exactly once through the authoritative stack composer. Both controls default on with explicit configuration rollback. -->

## Purpose

Defines the security model for Waaseyaa's default content types, API access, and configuration handling. Ensures secrets never leak into version-controlled manifests and that RBAC is enforced at the API layer before entity-level access checks fire.

## Threat Model

The `defaults/` directory contains declarative manifests (YAML) and JSON Schema files. These files are:

- **Version-controlled** — committed to the repository
- **Non-executable** — never `require`d or `eval`d at runtime
- **Read by `DefaultsSchemaRegistry`** — only `*.schema.json` files, only `x-waaseyaa` metadata

Attack surfaces:

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Secret committed anywhere in repository source | Repository-wide `bin/check-no-secrets` CI gate; generated dependency/build trees are excluded |
| Secret embedded structurally in `defaults/` | `DefaultsSecretsIntegrationTest` structural value scan |
| Manifest referencing external endpoint | YAML manifests are governance docs, not runtime config |
| Anonymous write to entity API | Route-level `_authenticated` option on POST/PATCH/DELETE |

## RBAC Enforcement at the API Layer

Access control is enforced in three layers, evaluated in sequence:

| Layer | Mechanism | Failure code |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Route-level authentication** | `_authenticated` route option → `AccessChecker` → `AuthorizationMiddleware` | 401 Unauthorized |
| **Route-level authorization** | `_permission` / `_role` / `_gate` route options → `AccessChecker` | 403 Forbidden |
| **Entity-level access** | `EntityAccessHandler` → `AccessPolicyInterface` implementations | 403 Forbidden |
| **Field-level access** | `EntityAccessHandler::checkFieldAccess()` → `FieldAccessPolicyInterface` | Field omitted from response |

### Route-level authentication

All entity CRUD write routes (POST, PATCH, DELETE) require authentication via the `_authenticated` route option. Anonymous requests receive HTTP 401 with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header.

Read routes (GET index, GET show) do **not** require authentication at the route level. Entity access policies control read authorization — this preserves the ability for entity types to serve public content.

### Entity-level access for core.note

The `NoteAccessPolicy` enforces:

| Operation | tenant.member | tenant.admin | platform.admin | anonymous |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| view | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed | Neutral (denied) |
| create | — | Allowed | Allowed | Neutral (denied) |
| update | — | Allowed | Allowed | Neutral (denied) |
| delete | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden | Forbidden |

### Field-level access for core.note

System fields (`id`, `uuid`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) are read-only for all roles except `platform.admin`. `tenant_id` is settable on creation but immutable on update.

See also: `docs/specs/access-control.md`, `docs/specs/field-access.md`.

### GraphQL authentication model

The GraphQL endpoint is registered with `allowAll()` at the route level — no route-level authentication. This is intentional: GraphQL serves both public queries and authenticated mutations through a single endpoint.

Access enforcement happens at the resolver level via `GraphQlAccessGuard`. Mutations that require authentication check the `_account` on the request and return a `UserError` on denial. This follows the same pattern as REST read routes: route is open, entity access policies control authorization.

### HTTP response security headers

`HttpKernel` wires `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` around real controller/domain-router dispatch, so framing / MIME-sniffing headers reach **every dispatched response** during the pipeline's response phase:

| Header | Default | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `X-Frame-Options` | `SAMEORIGIN` | Blocks cross-origin framing (clickjacking) while preserving same-origin inline previews. Configurable via `security_headers.frame_options`. **Omitted** when the matched route set the `_frame_exempt` request attribute (`SecurityHeadersMiddleware::FRAME_EXEMPT_ATTRIBUTE`) — the per-route opt-out for content meant to be framed cross-origin. |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Always applied. |

The protected-media inline surface (`GET /media/{id}/view`) does not use the
framing exemption, so the canonical `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` response
policy denies cross-origin framing while permitting a same-origin iframe. It
does not set its own CSP: an explicitly configured deployment CSP remains
authoritative and is not suppressed by the media response. Request headers and
media metadata cannot opt the route into a looser framing policy.

Provider-contributed HTTP middleware uses the same onion response phase: code after `$next->handle()` receives the final response. This is the supported app hook for response headers, cookies, compression, and equivalent response decoration. See [middleware-pipeline.md](middleware-pipeline.md).

`Content-Security-Policy` and `Strict-Transport-Security` are **opt-in**, NOT applied by the kernel defaults: `default-src 'self'` would break consumer SPAs and same-origin inline previews, and HSTS needs HTTPS certainty. A deployment configures the one kernel-owned instance through `security_headers.csp`, `.hsts_enabled`, and `.hsts_max_age`; providers must not contribute a second `SecurityHeadersMiddleware`. The constructor defaults remain `default-src 'self'` / `X-Frame-Options: DENY` / HSTS-on for standalone use.

### Rate limiting

`HttpKernel` activates `RateLimitMiddleware` exactly once at priority 80. It enforces IP-based rate limiting at 60 requests per 60-second fixed window by default. Exceeding the limit returns HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`. Production uses `DatabaseRateLimiter` over the kernel's canonical database, so windows are shared across requests and workers; `InMemoryRateLimiter` is only a process-local test or explicit standalone option. Operators may override positive integers at `http_security.rate_limit.max_attempts` and `.window_seconds`, or set `.enabled` to `false` for emergency rollback.

### Request body limits

`HttpKernel` activates `BodySizeLimitMiddleware` exactly once at priority 70 and rejects payloads exceeding 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes) with HTTP 413. Operators may override the positive integer at `http_security.body_size_limit.max_bytes`, or set `.enabled` to `false` for emergency rollback.

This kernel cap runs before route controllers, including MCP. `mcp.transport.max_request_bytes` defaults to the same 1 MiB and cannot be set above an enabled kernel ceiling — otherwise the advertised MCP number is unreachable. Lowering the MCP cap below the kernel limit still lets the transport guard refuse first. Disabling `body_size_limit` makes the MCP setting the effective ceiling. See [mcp-endpoint.md](mcp-endpoint.md) "dispatch() (private)".

### CSRF token cookie

State-changing routes (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) require a valid CSRF token accepted from a form field, the `X-CSRF-Token` header, or the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header (URL-decoded); every `text/html` response sets the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie so Inertia + Vue consumers get protection automatically with no consumer-side code. See [docs/conventions/csrf-token-cookie.md](../conventions/csrf-token-cookie.md) for runnable examples and the full cookie-attribute table.

The `_csrf` route option is three-valued (#2177 F1 prerequisite):

| `_csrf` | Set by | Behaviour on state-changing methods |
|---|---|---|
| *(unset)* | default | Validate, **except** for the exempt content types `application/json` / `application/vnd.api+json` (browsers cannot send those from HTML forms) |
| `false` | `RouteBuilder::csrfExempt()` | Never validate — the route has its own authentication model (MCP bearer, API keys) |
| `true` | `RouteBuilder::requireCsrf()` | **Always validate, JSON content types included.** The explicit opt-in takes precedence over the content-type exemption, because a cookie-authenticated JSON endpoint *is* CSRF-reachable: the content-type exemption only holds while the session cookie is not the sole authenticator of a JSON request whose side effects matter (`fetch` can send `application/json` cross-origin; the browser will attach the session cookie unless SameSite blocks it) |

No framework route sets `_csrf = true` yet — the first consumer is the MCP write-tier approval controller (#2177 F1). Opted-in routes still accept all three token sources; SPA callers use the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header fed from the cookie.

Cookie delivery: `CsrfMiddleware` writes the configured CSRF cookie (default name `XSRF-TOKEN`) on every `text/html` response (unchanged), **and** on any response — JSON included — whose request carries an authenticated `_account` plus a non-empty `waaseyaa_uid` login-session marker (`CsrfMiddleware::attachCookieIfAuthenticated()`). The admin SPA boots against JSON endpoints (`GET /api/user/me`) and never sees a kernel HTML response, so the session-authenticated path seeds its token without exposing it to bearer-only requests. Cookie flags are identical on both paths (`HttpOnly=false`, with `Path`/`Domain`/`Secure`/`SameSite` taken from the resolved `session.cookie` policy shared with the session cookie — forced `secure => true` stays `Secure` on plaintext requests, the `'auto'` default follows the trusted request scheme, and the default `SameSite` is `Lax`; #2149). Setting `session.cookie.host_bound => true` selects the `__Host-` profile: Secure, `Path=/`, no Domain, and distinct `__Host-` session/CSRF names; incompatible configured or already-active session settings are rejected (#3047). Anonymous and bearer-only non-HTML responses stay cookie-free. A CSRF 403 on an opted-in route also re-delivers the cookie to an authenticated login session so a stale-token client can recover without a page reload. The Admin SPA request and upload CSRF readers share `packages/admin/app/utils/csrfCookie.ts` and the public `csrfCookieName` runtime config (#3031).

Origin checking is **not** part of this middleware: the CORS allowlist lives at the kernel level (`CorsHandler`), and a middleware-level same-origin guard would break the supported Nuxt-dev deployment (SPA on `localhost:3000` calling the PHP API cross-port). Endpoints whose side effects warrant defense-in-depth beyond the token — the MCP approval controller — should verify the `Origin`/`Referer` header against the deployment's allowed origins in the controller itself (see `docs/specs/mcp-endpoint.md`).

## Encryption Policy

### Current (pre-v1)

- `body` field is stored as plaintext in the `_data` JSON blob column
- No at-rest encryption is applied by `SqlEntityStorage`
- Transport-layer encryption (TLS) is the operator's responsibility
- The `core.note.yaml` manifest declares `encryption_policy: none`

### Future opt-in path

When field-level encryption is implemented:

- The manifest value will become the algorithm name (e.g., `aes-256-gcm`)
- Key management will be the operator's responsibility via a `WAASEYAA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var
- Existing plaintext data will require a migration command

## Secrets Handling

### Invariant: no secrets in repository source

Version-controlled source — including `defaults/`, packages, scripts, documentation, and workflows — must **never** contain credentials, tokens, or connection strings. Bootstrap-only legacy variables remain at documented kernel seams; governed integration and provider credentials use deployable `SecretReference` values and are resolved through the frozen kernel-owned `SecretResolverRegistry`. References contain provider, identifier, expected secret class, and versioned purpose but are not secret values; JSON and debug diagnostic views disclose only their fingerprint, class, and purpose, while configuration encoders must deliberately request the complete `toArray()` projection. `bin/check-no-secrets` scans the repository root and excludes only generated or dependency trees (`.git`, `.worktrees`, `vendor`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, and `tmp`). Test fixtures assemble secret-shaped dummy values from fragments so the repository contains no static token-like payload.

### Transitional environment variable contract

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `WAASEYAA_JWT_SECRET` | HS256 shared secret for bearer auth | Only if bearer auth is used |
| `WAASEYAA_DEV_FALLBACK_ACCOUNT` | Dev-only auto-auth as platform admin | **Must be false in production** |

Full listing: `.env.example`.

`WAASEYAA_APP_SECRET` remains the Layer-0 compatibility bootstrap authority while existing consumers migrate. New versioned application-master custody uses externally provisioned typed references, one active-write version, explicitly declared legacy read/verify versions, guarded purpose-specific consumers, authenticated version-bound envelopes, and frozen resolver and purpose registries. External application-master references are immutable: providers must never replace bytes in place, and each rotation uses a distinct reference and monotonically higher keyring version. Framework custody resolves the selected reference for each operation and retains no master bytes between operations. It never generates a missing operational master or probes undeclared versions. The persisted rekey coordinator and consumer migration remain explicit CFG-04 work, so the compatibility adapter is not rotation evidence and must not be used as precedent for new integrations. Governed MCP and AI provider credentials likewise use typed references and registered consumers; their packages reject direct environment or secret-file reads.

The OIDC issuer contributes three application-master purpose owners through `OidcServiceProvider::applicationMasterRekeyContributions()` (`packages/oidc/src/Rekey/`): `OidcAccessTokenRekeyAdapter` (adapter id `oidc-access-token-v1`) and `OidcRefreshTokenRekeyAdapter` (`oidc-refresh-token-v1`) each jointly own their token table's ciphertext and lookup-index purposes (`waaseyaa.oidc.access-token-encryption.v1` + `waaseyaa.oidc.access-token-lookup.v1`; refresh likewise) and rekey rows through shared joint-row compare-and-swap mechanics (`AbstractOidcTokenRekeyAdapter`); `OidcSigningKeyRekeyAdapter` (`oidc-signing-key-v1`) owns `waaseyaa.oidc.signing-key-encryption.v1` for signing private material. Legacy custody is opt-in per adapter and fail-closed at construction: the token adapters require both 32-byte legacy purpose keys or neither.

### Configuration secrets

The legacy `api_keys` map and raw provider-key configuration are not compliant with the governed custody contract merely because a deployment file is untracked. MCP schema v2 uses explicit `none` or `secret-reference` authentication plus `required` or `optional` availability. AI provider schema v2 uses exact class-and-purpose references. Legacy environment-name fields migrate to central-provider references without resolution; raw values and direct-environment bypasses are refused. Signing custody, the versioned application-master transition, and consumers outside the governed AI/MCP scope remain tracked red conditions.

### Enforcement

| Check | Type | Location |
|-------|------|----------|
| `bin/check-no-secrets` | Repository-wide shell scan for token patterns | CI: `security-defaults` job |
| `DefaultsSecretsIntegrationTest` | Structural YAML/JSON value scanning | CI: PHPUnit `--filter Phase22` |
| `HermeticAdminBuildPipeline` | Closed child environment, pinned Node/npm execution, credential-free lock-integrity cache, bounded line-sanitized output/runtime, deterministic generated/publishable artifact inventory and byte scan | `admin:build` and `bin/build-admin-dist` |
| `AdminDistWorkspaceGuard` + `AdminDistAcceptance` | Refuses an ambiguous source/generated boundary (unmerged paths, conflict markers, untracked app source, partially staged output); refuses an unpinned Node major, a single build snapshot presented twice, and a non-reproducible build pair; replaces the published tree wholesale and proves obsolete paths are gone; refuses a bundle missing a declared source-contract marker | `bin/build-admin-dist` via `bin/admin-dist-acceptance` |
| `AdminDistAcceptanceVerifier` | Committed-state re-derivation of the published tree digest, source-signature parity, Nuxt build identity and marker satisfaction; consumer-verifiable release identity in `packages/admin-surface/dist.manifest.json` | `bin/admin-dist-acceptance verify` (`check-admin-dist-manifest`) |
