<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-09-21 - permission catalogue ownership (#3119): ai-tools implements ProvidesPermissionsInterface and contributes the shared `tool.content.search` descriptor only when its optional search adapter is available; the capability id and definition come from `AgentCapabilities::seed()`, so tool authorization and the permission catalogue cannot drift.

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-08-30 - #2657: `waaseyaa/ai-tools` gains two
namespaces that are library code only — no service provider, no route, no
attribute, no discovery convention. `Dispatch/` holds `ToolDispatcherInterface`
and `AgentToolDispatcher`, the schema-enforcing, exception-sanitizing,
audit-stage-classifying dispatch path lifted verbatim out of
`Waaseyaa\Mcp\Bridge\AgentToolRegistryBridge` (which now delegates to it), plus
`AuditedToolDispatcher`, a reserve-before-side-effect decorator that refuses to
construct on an absent or record-nothing `StrictAuditLedgerInterface` and takes
its audit surface and correlation id from the calling transport. Every path out
of its `dispatch()` is either durably recorded or answered with
`AUDIT_TRAIL_UNAVAILABLE`: caller-supplied tool names are projected through
`auditOperation()` so the strict ledger always receives a non-empty bounded
operation (a blank name becomes `tool_name_unusable` with the raw value kept in
`metadata`), and a terminal refusal the ledger rejects is refused to the caller
rather than answered as an ordinary lookup miss. `Registry/`
holds the shared `CapabilityScopedToolRegistry` the MCP tier now delegates to,
and `ToolIdAllowlistRegistry`, an exact-membership narrowing decorator for
ADR-022 D-7 closed-list local profile. Tool authorization is unchanged:
`AbstractAgentTool::requireCapability()` remains the only authorization layer

Every MCP server row now declares auth_mode (none|secret-reference) and availability (required|optional): an optional server's startup/call failure records degraded McpIntegrationHealth and yields no tools; a REQUIRED server's failure throws McpReadinessException and blocks boot — this supersedes the 2026-07-13 "an unavailable server cannot abort kernel boot" claim for required servers.

<!-- Spec reviewed 2026-07-05 - audit-remediation batch R8 WP2 (security, audit R8-c): `RelationshipTraverseTool` (`relationship.traverse`, `packages/ai-tools/src/Relationship/RelationshipTraverseTool.php`) gated only the edge row (`canViewEntity($row)`) and the FAR endpoint (`canViewEndpoint()` on `to_entity_type`/`to_entity_id`) but NEVER the SOURCE entity's own view access — a code comment rationalized "the source is the caller's own query input, so its visibility is implied", the confused-deputy/existence-oracle pattern. `tool.relationship.traverse` is on `PublicAnonymousAuth::DEFAULT_READ_CAPABILITIES`, so an anonymous MCP caller could supply `source_id` = a restricted node and, if it had any published edge to a viewable entity, receive a non-empty `edges` array echoing the restricted source id — confirming the entity exists and has that relationship (the same disclosure the HTTP `DiscoveryRouter` hub/cluster/timeline gate closes; see docs/specs/api-layer.md). Fixed with a new fail-closed `RelationshipTraverseTool::canViewSource()` (mirrors the existing `canViewEndpoint()`: unknown type / unloadable / policy-denied → not viewable; capability-only mode allows, enforced-with-no-handler fails closed) run BEFORE querying edges; when the source is not viewable the tool returns an EMPTY result (`edges: [], count: 0`) via `emptyTraversalResult()`, INDISTINGUISHABLE from "source has no relationships" / "source absent". The stale endpoint-gate comment was updated to state the source is now gated up front. Acceptance: `RelationshipTraverseAccessFilterTest::traverse_returns_empty_when_the_source_entity_is_view_forbidden`, `::forbidden_source_is_indistinguishable_from_an_absent_source`, `::traverse_returns_the_edge_when_the_source_entity_is_viewable` (positive control); the three pre-existing edge/endpoint tests now seed a viewable source so they exercise the filter they are about. This closes the source-existence-oracle class on the MCP surface, completing the HTTP-surface fix in the same batch. ALSO in this batch, the absent-vs-forbidden form of the same oracle was closed on `EntityReadTool` (`entity.read`) and `EntityListRevisionsTool` (`entity.list_revisions`) — both on the anonymous read tier via `tool.entity.read`. They returned a distinguishable "not permitted to view" (from `requireEntityAccess()`) for an existing-but-forbidden id vs "not found" for an absent id; both now collapse the absent and view-forbidden outcomes into the IDENTICAL `... not found` error via `$entity === null || !$this->canViewEntity($entity, $account)` (the shared `requireEntityAccess()` is UNCHANGED — the destructive write tools off the anonymous tier keep their 'forbidden' message). A viewable entity still returns its data/revisions. Acceptance: `EntityReadOracleClosureTest`. With this, the anonymous MCP read tier (`entity.read`, `entity.search`, `relationship.traverse`, `bimaaji.read`) is free of entity-existence oracles — `entity.search` already filters forbidden hits silently, `bimaaji.read` is not id-scoped. -->

A vector hit carries only a type+id, so the tool now takes an injected EntityTypeManagerInterface, loads each hit's backing entity, drops it unless canViewEntity() allows (fail-closed when the entity can't be loaded under enforcement), filters surviving metadata through applyFieldAccessFilter(), and reshapes output to {entity_type,id,score,metadata} (the raw vector is no longer echoed).

Waaseyaa's AI layer (architecture layer 5) provides four packages that enable AI agents to introspect, mutate, and search CMS content. All four packages sit in the `packages/` directory and follow the standard `Waaseyaa\AI\*` namespace pattern.

## Packages

| Package | Namespace | Path | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|
| ai-schema | `Waaseyaa\AI\Schema\` | `packages/ai-schema/src/` | Standalone JSON Schema generation from entity definitions |
| ai-agent | `Waaseyaa\AI\Agent\` | `packages/ai-agent/src/` | Agent executor, audit logging, MCP server adapter |
| ai-pipeline | `Waaseyaa\AI\Pipeline\` | `packages/ai-pipeline/src/` | Pipeline configuration entity; no execution or queue surface |
| ai-vector | `Waaseyaa\AI\Vector\` | `packages/ai-vector/src/` | Vector embeddings, similarity search, distance metrics |

### Package Dependencies

```
ai-schema   -> entity
ai-agent    -> access, ai-observability, ai-tools, api, audit, bimaaji, config,
               database-legacy, entity, entity-storage, foundation, http-client, routing
ai-pipeline -> entity, foundation
ai-vector   -> access, api, database-legacy, entity, entity-storage, foundation, workflows
```

`ai-schema` is an independently shipped utility; no agent runtime or MCP
resource currently consumes it. `ai-agent` declares only the packages its
executor, persistence, tool, API, routing, and remote-client paths use. Any
future schema capability-registry integration must add a deliberate dependency
and an executable contract test.

## Schema Generation

**File:** `packages/ai-schema/src/EntityJsonSchemaGenerator.php`
**Class:** `Waaseyaa\AI\Schema\EntityJsonSchemaGenerator`

Adapts the lower-layer `FieldSchemaAuthority` to JSON Schema draft 2020-12.
The utility enumerates the effective field set and requires an explicit entity
subject, access handler, and immutable principal before it can expose schema.

### Constructor

```php
public function __construct(
    private readonly EntityTypeManagerInterface $entityTypeManager,
    ?FieldSchemaAuthority $fieldSchemas = null,
    ?FieldVisibilityPolicy $fieldVisibility = null,
)
```

Both optional collaborators default to the shared Layer-1 authorities: the
the built-ins-only `FieldTypeManager::default()` registry and a `FieldVisibilityPolicy`
with framework-only internal fields. A kernel-bound caller injects the
boot-scoped `FieldSchemaAuthority` so manifest-discovered downstream field
types are projected, and injects the container's visibility policy so
application-declared internal fields are honoured. No first-party provider
constructs this generator; bare construction remains explicitly isolated.

### Key Methods

- `generate(string $entityTypeId, EntityInterface $entity, EntityAccessHandler $accessHandler, AuthorizationPrincipalInterface $account): array` -- Produces one principal-bound schema after entity and field access checks.

### Schema Shape

The generated schema includes entity keys plus every effective field visible to
the principal. Before the per-field access check runs, the shared Layer-1
`FieldVisibilityPolicy` floor removes credential names (`pass`, `legacy_pass`,
`password`, `password_hash`), framework-internal fields, application-declared
internal fields, and any definition carrying `settings.internal`; the same
floor backs the API package's `InternalFieldVisibilityPolicy`, so REST and AI
introspection cannot disagree about which fields are structurally internal.
Field plugins own the value shapes; cardinality, required state,
read-only state, and translation/revision metadata are explicit. The result is
closed with `additionalProperties: false`, and unknown field types fail closed.
There is no unscoped `generateAll()` catalogue.

## Agent Tool System

### Application tool contribution

Framework packages normally contribute `#[AsAgentTool]` classes through the compiled package manifest. Applications and providers that assemble tools from application-owned configuration implement `Waaseyaa\AI\Tools\ProvidesAgentToolsInterface`. During kernel boot, contributors are sorted by provider class and injected into `AiToolsServiceProvider`; each receives the canonical `ToolRegistryInterface` when that singleton is first constructed. Registration is therefore independent of HTTP route declaration, works for embedded-agent and MCP consumers alike, and preserves the registry's fail-closed duplicate-name rule. Contributors must not resolve the registry recursively or capture request-scoped services.

### Schema ownership

`Waaseyaa\AI\Tools\AgentTool` owns the protocol-visible input and output
schemas for shipped tools. `ToolInputSchemaValidator` validates the exact
advertised input schema before execution, and MCP serializes those descriptors
through its `AgentToolRegistryBridge`. None of those paths imports
`waaseyaa/ai-schema`; `EntityJsonSchemaGenerator` remains an independent
utility until a future capability-registry integration is deliberately built
and tested.

The canonical content mutation tools add the optional
`save_advisory_acknowledgements` input to `createDraft` and `updateDraft`
(maximum 32 unique lowercase SHA-256 tokens). The schema validator enforces the
shape before execution. A storage advisory remains the authored structured
`SAVE_ADVISORY_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_REQUIRED` publishing error, including
`meta.save_advisories`, so MCP callers can review and retry the same candidate;
it is not routed through generic internal-error sanitization.

### Result content blocks

A tool result crosses into MCP as content blocks, and MCP defines exactly five
block types: `text`, `image`, `audio`, `resource` and `resource_link`. A tool
returning structured data emits a `text` block carrying the JSON alongside
`structuredContent` carrying the same payload, so clients with and without
schema support both get something usable:

```php
return AgentToolResult::success(
    content: [['type' => 'text', 'text' => $json]],
    structuredContent: $data,
);
```

Until #2520 the entity, vector and relationship tools in `waaseyaa/ai-tools`
and the ten Bimaaji and Wayfinding tools in `packages/ai-agent/src/Tool/`
emitted `['type' => 'json', 'data' => …]` instead, with no `structuredContent`
and no text mirror. `type: "json"` is not an MCP content type and
`AgentToolRegistryBridge` forwards tool content to the wire unchanged, so a
schema-validating client received a block it could only discard. The defect was
invisible to the suite because tests asserted on `$result->content[0]['data']`
in process, never on what a client decodes.

Encoding is the tool's own responsibility: `json_encode` runs with
`JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR` and the `\JsonException` arm routes through
`AbstractAgentTool::internalError()`, since payloads carry arbitrary stored
field values and invalid UTF-8 is a live path — `SearchSpecsTool`, which reads
arbitrary spec-file bytes, could not fail this way before because nothing
encoded.

`packages/ai-agent/tests/Contract/Tool/` sweeps the agent-tier tools by
executing them — `execute()` and `dryRun()` alike — and inspecting real emitted
results, so a new tool that reintroduces a non-MCP block type lands as a
failure rather than as a client-side surprise.

`entity.read` and `entity.search` additionally map a WP4 `FieldReadDenied`
during field projection to **omission** of that field (success result, no
`INTERNAL_ERROR`, no named-field error). That is JSON:API parity, not a new
disclosure policy; see docs/specs/mcp-endpoint.md "FieldReadDenied on
anonymous `entity.read` / `entity.search`".

### Local operator principal and the default local profile (ADR-022, #2658)

`packages/ai-agent/src/LocalOperator/` holds the acting identity of the local
AI-development plane. It exists because a CLI process runs under SAPI `cli`,
which is absent from `HttpKernel::DEV_FALLBACK_SAPIS`
(`['cli-server', 'frankenphp']`), so a stdio transport starts with no acting
account and `AbstractAgentTool::requireCapability()` refuses every call.
ADR-022 C-2 forbids the obvious shortcut — `DevAdminAccount`, whose own
`ALLOWED_SAPIS` *does* include `cli`, and which is a wildcard on every axis.

| Class | Role |
|---|---|
| `LocalOperatorPrincipal` | The never-persisted `AuthorizationPrincipalInterface`. Fixed string sentinel id `local-operator:stdio`, strict-membership `hasPermission()`, role `local_operator`, unbound tenant/community, and a `claimsGeneration()` digest over the granted capabilities, the admitted tool ids, the active `SovereigntyProfile`, and any tenant/community binding. Also supplies `auditActorUid()` (always `null`) and `auditMetadata()` for a `StrictAuditReservation`. |
| `LocalOperatorTransportAttestation` | The only constructor gate (D-6 R-6). Refuses a SAPI other than `cli`, a runtime that is not an explicitly configured development environment (`RuntimePolicy::isExplicitDevelopment()`), and any transport id other than `waaseyaa.local.stdio`. **`PHP_SAPI` is consulted unconditionally and first**; the `$narrowingSapi` test seam is consulted second and can only ADD a refusal — see "The SAPI seam narrows only" below. |
| `LocalOperatorToolProfile` | The D-7 default catalogue: an explicit tool-ID allowlist (`bimaaji_introspect_graph`, `bimaaji_introspect_section`, `bimaaji_search_specs`) plus the capability grant (`bimaaji.read`). Refuses any capability on `WITHHELD_CAPABILITIES`, which is D-8's fail-closed posture until a read-side sovereignty evaluation exists. |
| `LocalOperatorAccountContextGuard` | An `AccountContextInterface` decorator that refuses the principal on **both** `set()` and `current()` (D-6 R-4). `EntityRepository::resolveActor()` casts the ambient account id to `int`, and `(int) 'local-operator:stdio'` is `0` — the `AnonymousUser` id. Guarding only `set()` would leave two live paths to a prohibited read: wrapping a context that already holds the principal, and mutation of the inner context through a second reference taken before the wrap. `current()` is the side `resolveActor()` actually consumes. The transport wraps its account context in one; the principal is passed directly to the gate and to `requireCapability()`, never installed as the ambient actor. |
| `LocalOperatorRefusal` | The loud failure every refusal row raises, carrying the ADR row (`R-4`, `R-5`, `R-6`, `D-7`, `D-8`) it discharges. |

**The SAPI seam narrows only.** `LocalOperatorTransportAttestation` accepts a
`$narrowingSapi` argument so a test can prove the refusal for a SAPI its own
process cannot run under. `PHP_SAPI` is checked unconditionally and first, and
the argument is checked second and only to add a refusal. The asymmetry is
load-bearing: a `$sapi ?? PHP_SAPI` resolution would let anything running under
a real `cli-server` process obtain a principal by passing the string `'cli'` —
a seam that can mint authority is not a seam. No in-process test can catch that
regression, because the suite runs under `cli` and both resolutions behave
identically there. `tests/Integration/LocalOperator/LocalOperatorHttpSapiRefusalTest.php`
therefore starts PHP's own built-in server (SAPI `cli-server`), issues an HTTP
request, and asserts refusal with every other gate deliberately satisfied. It
doubles as the end-to-end form of R-1.

**The out-of-process proofs are portable.** They invoke child PHP through
`proc_open()` with an argv array and an explicit environment map, never a
`NAME=value command` shell prefix — that is POSIX syntax, and `cmd.exe` parses
it as a program named `APP_ENV=local`, so on Windows the probe would not run at
all and the proof would pass vacuously. The native Windows CI lane
executes `packages/ai-agent/tests/Unit/LocalOperator` and
`tests/Integration/LocalOperator` on `windows-2025` so that portability is a
tested claim. The D-7.3 roster-gate sandbox is excluded from that lane: it
builds its fixture tree with `symlink()`, which needs Developer Mode on
Windows, and it exercises a gate that runs on the Linux lanes. Since #2678
these tests run in the `native-host-contract` matrix on `ubuntu-24.04` and
`windows-2025`, which replaced `ci/local-operator-windows`, under PHPUnit's
skip-, incomplete- and empty-selection failures. They remain a narrow proof of
the local-operator trust boundary, not the local AI-plane parity #2680 owns.

**The allowlist is not a capability grant, and that distinction is gated.**
`requireCapability()` evaluates a capability string and consults no tool
roster, so a future class carrying `#[AsAgentTool(capability: 'bimaaji.read')]`
would otherwise join the default profile on discovery.
`bin/check-local-operator-tool-profile` scans every `#[AsAgentTool]` and every
literal `new AgentTool(...)` under `packages/*/src`, classifies each as
`default-profile` / `capability-admissible` / `withheld` /
`dynamic-registration`, and diffs against
`support/local-operator-tool-profile-roster.json`. Detection is a token walk, so
it tolerates arbitrary whitespace, and the cheap file prefilter is the bare
identifier `AgentTool` — a strict superset of what the walk can match. That
matters: a prefilter of `'AgentTool('` made `new AgentTool (` (one space, valid
PHP, lints clean) invisible, and the gate reported green with an unrostered
`bimaaji.read` tool present. The gate's entire value rests on its scan being
complete, so both spacings carry seeded regression controls. The `capability-admissible`
class — granted capability, unlisted tool id — is empty today and cannot grow
without a deliberate roster update. Two cross-checks read
`LocalOperatorToolProfile::DEFAULT_TOOL_IDS` rather than the roster, so a
reflexive `--write-roster` cannot silence a rename or removal. Seeded positive
control: `tests/Architecture/LocalOperatorToolProfileGateTest.php`.

**Not owned here.** `bimaaji_search_specs` is on the allowlist and inert until
#2661 and #2662 — `BimaajiServiceProvider::resolveSpecsDirectory()` returns
`null` unless `bimaaji.specs_directory` is configured, and `docs/specs/` ships
in no package. The dispatch path (reserve/finalize wrapper, `NullStrictAuditLedger`
refusal) is #2657's, discharged in `waaseyaa/ai-tools`. The stdio transport
itself — the `surface` constant, per-request correlation id, and the
conformant JSON-RPC server — is #2659's, discharged below.

### Local stdio MCP transport (`mcp:serve`, ADR-022 D-9.2, #2659)

`waaseyaa mcp:serve --profile=developer` speaks conformant JSON-RPC 2.0 over
stdin/stdout: newline-delimited request/response objects, no batching, no
resources/prompts capability (only `tools`). It is a CLI command, not a
`waaseyaa/mcp` route — installing it registers zero HTTP surface, per ADR-022
D-1.4/D-9.1, and it works when `waaseyaa/mcp` is not installed at all.

| Class | Package | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `Waaseyaa\CLI\Mcp\Stdio\StdioMcpServer` | `waaseyaa/ai-tools`-only deps | The read loop: `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`; every other method is `-32601`. Writes ONLY complete JSON-RPC frames to its `$out` stream — every diagnostic goes through an injected closure the caller wires to stderr. Listing goes through the injected `ToolDispatcherInterface` unaudited (`tools()`/`tool()` only, matching D-5.B: `initialize`/`ping`/`tools/list` mutate nothing); `tools/call` goes through a caller-supplied `$dispatch` closure so a correlation id can be minted fresh per request (D-5.C.6) — this class never constructs the audited dispatcher itself. |
| `Waaseyaa\CLI\Mcp\Stdio\StdioMcpProtocol` | none | Protocol-version negotiation, independent of `Waaseyaa\Mcp\McpProtocol` on purpose — depending on `waaseyaa/mcp` to borrow four strings would pull in its route registrar (ADR-022 C-4). |
| `Waaseyaa\CLI\Mcp\Stdio\StdioJsonRpcErrorCode` | none | The five base JSON-RPC 2.0 codes this transport needs; it has no rate limiter, bearer auth, or Origin check, so none of `Waaseyaa\Mcp\McpErrorCode`'s `-31xxx` band applies here. |
| `Waaseyaa\CLI\Mcp\Stdio\StdioServerExecutableResolver` | none | Pure function: project root (POSIX or Windows shaped) → `{command, args}` for invoking `vendor/bin/waaseyaa mcp:serve`. Always `PHP_BINARY` or an injected override, never the bare string `'php'` — the acceptance criterion this class exists to satisfy ("reuses `waaseyaa dev`'s discipline, never assumes `command: php`"). Descriptor generation and machine-local configuration are owned by downstream #2663; see "Transferred" below. |
| `Waaseyaa\CLI\Command\Mcp\McpServeCommand` | `waaseyaa/ai-agent` (optional) | The wiring: constructs `LocalOperatorPrincipal::forLocalStdioTransport()`, narrows the host's `ToolRegistryInterface` with `ToolIdAllowlistRegistry` to the principal's D-7 tool ids, wraps it in `AgentToolDispatcher`, and — per `tools/call` — a fresh `AuditedToolDispatcher` with surface `McpServeCommand::AUDIT_SURFACE` (`waaseyaa.local.stdio`, never `mcp`/`mcp.*`), `$principal->auditActorUid()` (always `null`), and `$principal->auditMetadata()`. A construction-only `AuditedToolDispatcher` probe at startup (discarded, never dispatched) surfaces a `NullStrictAuditLedger` or surface-collision refusal before the read loop starts rather than on the first call. Every refusal — unsupported `--profile`, `LocalOperatorRefusal`, the audit probe — writes one structured JSON diagnostic to stderr and returns exit `1`; nothing reaches stdout. |
| `Waaseyaa\CLI\Provider\McpStdioServiceProvider` | — | Registers `mcp:serve`, gated on both `waaseyaa/ai-agent` and `waaseyaa/ai-tools` via `RequiresOptionalPackagesInterface`. `waaseyaa/cli` only `suggest`s both packages: a production `waaseyaa/cms` consumer does not gain the Layer-5 tool plane through `cms → cli`, while a development install carrying both packages exposes the command. |

**Audit correlation is provably real, not merely wired.** The stdio transport
mints the request identity and supplies it to both dispatcher layers. A
`tools/call` produces two `strict_audit_ledger` rows sharing that exact
`correlation_id`: a
`reserved` row (`request_accepted`) and a `finalized` row
(`execution_succeeded` / `_failed`), both `surface = 'waaseyaa.local.stdio'`,
`actor_uid` NULL, and `descriptor.metadata.principal =
'local-operator:stdio'`. The unit wiring tests cover successful dispatch and
the two sanitized-failure paths against an in-memory ledger. The integration
test `McpServeCorrelationIntegrationTest` repeats the hard cases — an escaping
exception and an output-schema violation — against
`DatabaseStrictAuditLedger` and a real SQLite `strict_audit_ledger`, proving
that response, safe log context, reservation, and finalization are joinable
without inference. Standalone `AgentToolDispatcher` callers retain their old
behaviour and mint an identity only when a sanitized failure needs one.

`tests/Integration/Mcp/StdioMcpConformanceTest.php`
spawns the real `mcp:serve` subprocess over real OS pipes (`proc_open`, not
`Symfony\Process`, because this session is interactive request/response, not
run-to-completion) and proves the FULL round trip: `initialize` negotiates a
protocol version, a `notifications/initialized` gets no response line at all,
`tools/list` returns only D-7-allowlisted names, `tools/call` succeeds, a
malformed line gets a `-32700` frame and the session keeps answering
afterward, and a production-shaped runtime refuses with **empty stdout** and
a non-zero exit — every line captured off the child's stdout pipe is asserted
to parse as JSON, which is how "a stray echo corrupts the stream" is proven
false rather than assumed. `Waaseyaa\CLI\Tests\Unit\Mcp\Stdio\StdioMcpServerTest`
covers the same protocol surface against `php://memory` streams and a stub
dispatcher, for the failure shapes too tedious to reach through a real
process (JSON-RPC batching rejected, wrong `jsonrpc` version, a thrown
exception inside `tools/call` sanitized to `Internal error.` on the wire
while stderr receives only exception class and method — never message,
arguments, credentials, or an absolute throw-site path).

**Historical kernel-boot gap and its bounded remediation (#3121).** The original
#2659 observation was that graph tool construction depended on an HTTP-only
live `RouteCollection`, so plain `ConsoleKernel` discovery could skip the graph
tools. ROUTE-METADATA-01 removes that construction dependency: Bimaaji obtains
the completed canonical kernel snapshot lazily at inspection, and refuses
incomplete, legacy or invalidated authority without an empty-graph fallback.
The release/consumer evidence is tracked in `docs/change-records/ROUTE-METADATA-01.md`.
This route fix does not claim complete MCP catalogue qualification. The
`AttributeToolRegistry` dependency-unavailable skip, configured allowlist,
capability checks and transport contracts remain unchanged.

**Official-client proof.** On 2026-09-03 the released MCP Inspector CLI
(`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` 2.5.0) started this branch's packaged
`mcp:serve --profile=developer` through an uncommitted, machine-local config
and completed strict `tools/list`. It observed exactly the one constructible,
approved tool (`bimaaji_search_specs`) and its declared input schema. The
config contained absolute checkout and PHP paths, remained outside the
repository, and is not a distributable artifact. The subprocess conformance
test remains the deterministic CI proof; Inspector is independent client
interoperability evidence.

**Official PHP SDK evaluation.** `mcp/sdk` v0.8.1 (released 2026-08-29) can
represent the handshake-era and 2026-07-28 protocols and supports custom
request handlers, so registry and audit injection are not technical blockers.
It is nevertheless pre-1.0, classified Tier 3 by the official SDK documentation,
and adoption in `waaseyaa/cli` would make a developer-only transport dependency
production-present for every CLI consumer. Moving it to optional
`waaseyaa/ai-agent` would invert package ownership, while the current
development metapackage has no code-bearing home for it. #2659 therefore keeps
the small transport implementation and does not adopt the SDK. Re-evaluate
when the SDK reaches a stable major or the package graph gains a code-bearing,
development-only transport owner.

**Transferred to #2663.** Portable launcher descriptors and machine-safe client
configuration are not shipped by #2659. #2663 owns their generation, safe
merge, source identity, drift detection, uninstall behaviour, supported-OS
bootstrap proof, and the rule that an absolute machine path is generated only
into a private/gitignored artifact. This issue supplies the resolver and
working server that #2663 consumes; the transfer is explicit rather than an
unowned deferral.

## Agent Execution

### Agent-run persistence and retention composition

`AgentRun` and `AgentAuditLog` are column-oriented framework entities. Their
`#[ContentEntityType]` declarations select `sql-column`, matching the package
migrations and the repositories' direct status/timestamp queries. The
`waaseyaa/ai-agent` Composer manifest declares its `migrations/` directory;
an additive migration supplies the mandatory `_data`, `bundle`, and `langcode`
entity base columns to tables created before that storage contract was explicit
or materialized earlier in the same fresh-install lifecycle.

The operator-facing `ai:purge-runs` command obtains its delete repository by
resolving the kernel-owned entity type manager and explicitly selecting
`agent_run`. The production services bus intentionally provides no arbitrary
context-free `EntityRepositoryInterface`. A purge deletes only terminal runs
older than the configured threshold; live runs and recent terminal runs remain.

### AgentInterface

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/AgentInterface.php`
**Class:** `Waaseyaa\AI\Agent\AgentInterface`

```php
interface AgentInterface
{
    public function execute(AgentContext $context): AgentResult;
    public function dryRun(AgentContext $context): AgentResult;
    public function describe(): string;
}
```

All agents must support both `execute()` (real mutations) and `dryRun()` (preview without changes). The `describe()` method returns a human-readable summary of the agent's purpose.

### AgentContext

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/AgentContext.php`
**Class:** `Waaseyaa\AI\Agent\AgentContext`

```php
final readonly class AgentContext
{
    public function __construct(
        public AccountInterface $account,   // user the agent acts as
        public array $parameters = [],      // agent-specific params
        public bool $dryRun = false,
        public int $maxIterations = 25,     // max tool loop iterations
    ) {}
}
```

Agents always operate as a specific user via `AccountInterface`. The `$parameters` array carries agent-specific input data. `$maxIterations` caps the provider tool loop — `AgentExecutor` throws `MaxIterationsException` when exceeded.

### AgentResult and AgentAction

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/AgentResult.php`

```php
final readonly class AgentResult
{
    public bool $success;
    public string $message;
    public array $data;
    public array $actions;   // AgentAction[]

    public static function success(string $message, array $data = [], array $actions = []): self;
    public static function failure(string $message, array $data = []): self;
}
```

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/AgentAction.php`

```php
final readonly class AgentAction
{
    public string $type;         // 'create', 'update', 'delete', 'tool_call'
    public string $description;  // human-readable
    public array $data;          // structured action data
}
```

### AgentExecutor

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/AgentExecutor.php`
**Class:** `Waaseyaa\AI\Agent\AgentExecutor`

Wraps agent execution with safety guarantees and audit logging. Five execution paths:

1. `execute(AgentInterface, AgentContext): AgentResult` -- Full execution with try/catch.
2. `dryRun(AgentInterface, AgentContext): AgentResult` -- Preview mode with try/catch.
3. `executeTool(string $toolName, array $arguments, AgentContext): array` -- MCP tool call on behalf of an agent.
4. `executeWithProvider(AgentInterface, AgentContext, ProviderInterface): AgentResult` -- Multi-turn tool loop with an LLM provider. Checks `AgentContext::maxIterations` per iteration; throws `MaxIterationsException` when exceeded.
5. `streamWithProvider(AgentInterface, AgentContext, StreamingProviderInterface, callable $onChunk): AgentResult` -- Streaming variant forwarding `StreamChunk` objects in real time.

Tool execution resolves the allowlisted descriptor through
`Waaseyaa\AI\Tools\ToolRegistryInterface` and invokes its `AgentToolInterface`
implementation as the supplied account. The agent runtime does not route tool
calls through `ai-schema`.

### Audit Logging

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/AgentAuditLog.php`

```php
final readonly class AgentAuditLog
{
    public string $agentId;    // agent FQCN or 'tool'
    public int $accountId;     // user ID the agent acted as
    public string $action;     // 'execute', 'dry_run', or 'tool_call'
    public bool $success;
    public string $message;
    public array $data;
    public int $timestamp;     // Unix timestamp
}
```

The audit log is in-memory (`AgentExecutor::$auditLog`), retrieved via `getAuditLog()`, and accumulates across multiple executions within the same executor instance.

### MCP endpoint

The framework's MCP-facing surface is `Waaseyaa\Mcp\McpServerCard` in `packages/mcp/`, wired by `McpRouteProvider` at `/.well-known/mcp.json`. See `docs/specs/mcp-endpoint.md`. The earlier `Waaseyaa\AI\Agent\McpServer` `tools/list` + `tools/call` adapter was deleted as orphan scaffolding (closes #1498); it was never reached and duplicated nothing the production path needed. If a `tools/list` / `tools/call` JSON-RPC surface becomes a requirement, it will be designed against the `McpServerCard` path, not resurrected.

### Tool failure contract — sanitized internal errors

Every `#[AsAgentTool]` tool wraps its storage work in a generic `catch (\Throwable)` so one failure cannot take down an agent run. That arm used to return `AgentToolResult::error(sprintf('<tool>: %s', $e->getMessage()))`, putting the raw exception message into the caller-visible result **and** into `AgentToolResult::summary`, which is the audit/transcript line. On the MCP surface that reached anonymous callers, so a failing storage call disclosed the database password, DSN, absolute vendor path and internal exception class.

The 11 generic arms — across `Entity\{Create,Delete,List,ListRevisions,Read,Rollback,Search,SetCurrentRevision,Update}Tool`, `Relationship\RelationshipTraverseTool` and `Vector\VectorSearchTool` — now call `AbstractAgentTool::internalError()`, which delegates to `Waaseyaa\AI\Tools\Error\SanitizedToolError`:

- **Caller** receives `{code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR', message: <fixed literal>, meta: {correlation_id: <16 hex>}}`. `summary` carries the code and correlation id only.
- **Logger** receives safe diagnostic metadata under `agent_tool.execution_failed` — correlation id, tool, exception class, file, line, and `getCode()` only when it is an integer. The exception message, stack trace, and the `Throwable` object itself are excluded; a log store is an indexed, widely-read egress path, so relocating a credential into it is not a fix. See `docs/specs/mcp-endpoint.md` for the full rationale and the bridge-side half of the same contract.
- The logger is attached at hydration by `AttributeToolRegistry::hydrate()` via `AbstractAgentTool::setLogger()`, the same mechanism that already attaches the `EntityAccessHandler`. Unlike access enforcement this is unconditional: it is a diagnostics concern, and a tool that cannot log still returns the identical sanitized result. Sanitization never depends on logger availability.

**Typed domain catches are deliberately untouched.** `EntityValidationException`, `RevisionConflictException`, the `LogicException` "not revisionable" arms, `EntityKeyGuard` refusals and per-tool `forbidden` results are authored, machine-readable outcomes an agent is meant to act on, and they are *returned* rather than thrown — they never pass through the sanitizer.

Covered by `packages/ai-tools/tests/Unit/Error/SanitizedToolErrorTest.php`.

## LLM Provider System

### ProviderInterface

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/ProviderInterface.php`

```php
interface ProviderInterface
{
    public function sendMessage(MessageRequest $request): MessageResponse;
}
```

### StreamingProviderInterface

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/StreamingProviderInterface.php`

```php
interface StreamingProviderInterface extends ProviderInterface
{
    /** @param callable(StreamChunk): void $onChunk */
    public function streamMessage(MessageRequest $request, callable $onChunk): MessageResponse;
}
```

### AnthropicProvider

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/AnthropicProvider.php`
**Implements:** `StreamingProviderInterface`

```php
final class AnthropicProvider implements StreamingProviderInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        #[\SensitiveParameter]
        string|SecretHandle $apiKey,
        private readonly string $model = 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
        ?\Closure $authenticatedTransport = null,
        ?ProviderTimeouts $timeouts = null,        // sendMessage bounds
        ?ProviderTimeouts $streamTimeouts = null,  // streamMessage bounds
        string $baseUrl = 'https://api.anthropic.com',
    );

    public function sendMessage(MessageRequest $request): MessageResponse;
    public function streamMessage(MessageRequest $request, callable $onChunk): MessageResponse;
    public function buildRequestBody(MessageRequest $request): array;
    public function parseResponse(array $data): MessageResponse;
    public function parseSseEvents(array $lines, callable $onChunk): array;
}
```

Uses cURL for HTTP. `CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION` callbacks must not throw — `json_decode` is wrapped in try-catch inside callbacks. Error handling parses error bodies and handles HTTP 429 with `RateLimitException`.

`$baseUrl` is the Messages API origin (`/v1/messages` is appended). It exists for Anthropic-compatible gateways and for transport tests; the constructor rejects any scheme other than http/https.

#### Transport time bounds

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/ProviderTimeouts.php`

```php
final readonly class ProviderTimeouts
{
    public function __construct(
        public float $connectSeconds = 5.0,
        public float $totalSeconds = 120.0,
        public int $lowSpeedBytesPerSecond = 0,  // 0 disables the abort
        public int $lowSpeedSeconds = 0,         // 0 disables the abort
    );

    public static function forRequest(): self;    // 5s connect, 120s total, no low-speed abort
    public static function forStreaming(): self;  // 5s connect, 300s total, abort under 1 B/s for 30s
    public function curlOptions(): array;         // CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS / _TIMEOUT_MS / _LOW_SPEED_*
}
```

A total timeout alone cannot bound a stalled peer cheaply (#2156), so each profile carries three independent bounds:

- **connect** caps the connection phase (DNS, TCP, TLS handshake) by itself, so a peer that accepts and never negotiates fails there instead of spending the whole request budget;
- **total** caps the exchange end to end;
- **low-speed** tears the transfer down once it stops delivering bytes. For streaming this is the bound that matters: a caller's own deadline runs inside the chunk callback, and a stalled stream delivers no chunk to run it.

The low-speed pair is off unless both halves are set, and only the streaming profile enables it by default — a non-streaming call is legitimately silent while the model generates. `ProviderTimeouts` rejects a non-positive bound, a connect bound larger than the total, and a half-configured low-speed abort. libcurl averages transfer speed over a rolling window, so a low-speed teardown trails its configured window by a few seconds; treat the window as a floor, not an exact deadline.

Both HTTP providers take these bounds. `AnthropicProvider` installs `forRequest()` for `sendMessage()` and `forStreaming()` for `streamMessage()`; `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` has no streaming path and installs `forRequest()` for its single exchange (#2445). Every bound is caller-settable, and the defaults preserve each provider's historical total.

A timeout surfaces as `TransportException`, which `AgentExecutor` already treats as retryable, and which the credential-custody boundary re-mints as `Provider transport unavailable.` — the endpoint and the cURL detail never reach the caller. Two test classes pin this against a local peer that stalls (`tests/Support/StallingTransportServer.php`, a raw TCP peer rather than an HTTP server, because the point is a peer that does not answer): `AnthropicProviderTransportTest` covers a TLS handshake that never completes and an SSE stream that goes silent after one delta, and `OpenAiCompatibleProviderTransportTest` covers the same handshake plus the non-streaming stall — a peer that promises a chat completion by `Content-Length`, delivers a prefix, and stops.

The API key is held as a `SecretHandle` (a plain string is wrapped into a legacy static handle). Every request resolves it inside the registered `AnthropicCredentialOperation` consumer (purpose `waaseyaa.ai.anthropic.v1`), which builds the `x-api-key`/`anthropic-version` headers so credential bytes never return to provider code. Failures cross the custody boundary only as `ProviderCredentialOutcome`'s closed taxonomy — `RateLimitException` (retry-after seconds preserved), `TransportException`, `ClientErrorException` — re-thrown with fixed non-secret messages; the original exception text and chain are discarded. `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` follows the same pattern via `OpenAiCompatibleCredentialOperation` (purpose `waaseyaa.ai.openai-chat.v1`).

### OpenAiCompatibleProvider

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/OpenAiCompatibleProvider.php`
**Implements:** `ProviderInterface` (no streaming)

```php
final class OpenAiCompatibleProvider implements ProviderInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        #[\SensitiveParameter]
        string|SecretHandle $apiKey,
        private readonly string $baseUrl = 'https://api.openai.com/v1',
        private readonly string $model = 'gpt-4o-mini',
        ?\Closure $authenticatedTransport = null,
        ?ProviderTimeouts $timeouts = null,  // sendMessage bounds
    );

    public function sendMessage(MessageRequest $request): MessageResponse;
    public static function parseChatCompletionResponse(array $data): MessageResponse;
}
```

Serves any OpenAI Chat Completions–compatible endpoint (OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, local gateways); `/chat/completions` is appended to `$baseUrl`. Text-in / text-out — tool loops must use `AnthropicProvider` until tool schema bridging exists.

Because there is no stream, the stall that matters is a silent *body* rather than a silent stream: a peer that answers, promises a completion, and then delivers only part of it. No chunk callback exists to notice, so only a transport bound can end it.

What the installed `forRequest()` profile does, precisely: connection establishment (DNS, TCP, TLS) is bounded at 5s, and the total stays at its historical 120s. Stalled-body protection is *available but not on* — the low-speed abort is off unless a caller sets it, so a peer that finishes connecting and then goes silent mid-body is still bounded only by the 120s total. That default is deliberate: a chat completion is legitimately silent while the model generates, and libcurl's byte-rate window covers that wait too, so enabling the abort by default would tear down healthy slow generations rather than stalled ones. A caller that knows its gateway responds promptly can pass `timeouts:` to enable it, and to set any of the three bounds.

`$authenticatedTransport` replaces cURL entirely, so the bounds do not apply to it; it is a test seam, not a transport policy.

### Message Block Value Objects

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/ToolUseBlock.php`

```php
final readonly class ToolUseBlock
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $id,
        public string $name,
        public array $input,     // array<string, mixed>
    );
}
```

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/ToolResultBlock.php`

```php
final readonly class ToolResultBlock
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $toolUseId,
        public string $content,
        public bool $isError = false,
    );

    public function toArray(): array;  // {type, tool_use_id, content, is_error}
}
```

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/StreamChunk.php`

```php
final readonly class StreamChunk

    public function __construct(
        public string $type,
        public string $text = '',
        public ?ToolUseBlock $toolUse = null,
    );
}
```

### Provider Exceptions

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/RateLimitException.php`

```php
final class RateLimitException extends \RuntimeException
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly int $retryAfterSeconds,
        string $message = '',
    );
}
```

Thrown by `AnthropicProvider` on HTTP 429. `$retryAfterSeconds` parsed from the `retry-after` header. Since CFG-04, callers receive a re-minted instance with a fixed message (`Provider rate limited.`) — `retryAfterSeconds` survives the custody boundary, the upstream error body text does not.

**File:** `packages/ai-agent/src/Provider/MaxIterationsException.php`

```php
final class MaxIterationsException extends \RuntimeException
{
    public function __construct(int $maxIterations);
}
```

Thrown by `AgentExecutor` when the tool loop exceeds `AgentContext::$maxIterations`.

## Hybrid Search Ranking Contract

The AI vector search surface is implemented by `Waaseyaa\AI\Vector\SearchController` (`packages/ai-vector/src/SearchController.php`).

When an embedding provider is available, search runs in semantic mode and may apply relationship-context reranking:

- Base semantic score from embedding similarity.
- Graph context boost from published relationship adjacency.
- Deterministic tie-break by original semantic order.

When graph reranking changes order, JSON:API response meta includes:

- `contract_version: v1.0`
- `contract_surface: semantic_search`
- `contract_stability: stable`
- `semantic_extension_hooks: [graph_context_rerank]`
- `ranking: semantic+graph_context`
- `ranking_weights`:
  - `semantic` (default `1.0`)
  - `graph_context` (default `0.001`)
- `graph_context_counts`: per-result relationship degree used in rerank
- `score_breakdown`: per-result deterministic explainability payload:
  - `semantic`
  - `graph_context`
  - `combined`
  - `base_rank`

Workflow visibility remains enforced at search output: node entities are only returned when resolved workflow state is `published`.

## Legacy AI-Assisted Discovery Blend Contract — REMOVED

The `ai_discover`, `search_entities`, and `search_teachings` MCP tools belonged
to the unrouted legacy `Waaseyaa\Mcp\McpController` stack removed in WP17
(#1738). They are not served by the live `Waaseyaa\Mcp\McpEndpoint`, and their
former blend payload and metadata are not current compatibility contracts.
Applications that need a remotely callable content-search tool must register a
new, access-checked agent tool through the canonical AI tool registry.

## Pipeline System

### Pipeline (Config Entity)

**File:** `packages/ai-pipeline/src/Pipeline.php`
**Class:** `Waaseyaa\AI\Pipeline\Pipeline`

Config entity (extends `ConfigEntityBase`) with entity type ID `'pipeline'` and keys `{id, label}`. Contains an ordered list of `PipelineStepConfig` objects.

Constructor accepts `array $values` with optional `description` (string) and `steps` (array of step data or `PipelineStepConfig` objects).

**Critical:** The Pipeline class uses `syncStepsToValues()` to prevent the dual-state bug pattern documented in CLAUDE.md. Step data is always kept in sync between the `$this->steps` array and `$this->values['steps']`. Any mutation (`addStep()`, `removeStep()`) calls `syncStepsToValues()` immediately.

### PipelineStepConfig

**File:** `packages/ai-pipeline/src/PipelineStepConfig.php`

```php
final readonly class PipelineStepConfig
{
    public string $id;            // step ID within the pipeline
    public string $pluginId;      // plugin ID of the step implementation
    public string $label;
    public int $weight;           // execution order (lower = first)
    public array $configuration;  // step-specific config
}
```

## Vector Storage and Embeddings

### EmbeddingInterface

**File:** `packages/ai-vector/src/EmbeddingInterface.php`

```php
interface EmbeddingInterface
{
    public function embed(string $text): array;          // float[]
    public function embedBatch(array $texts): array;     // float[][]
    public function getDimensions(): int;
}
```

Implementations connect to embedding providers. The `getDimensions()` method returns the vector dimensionality.

### Embedding Provider Implementations

**File:** `packages/ai-vector/src/OpenAiEmbeddingProvider.php`

```php
final class OpenAiEmbeddingProvider implements EmbeddingInterface, EmbeddingProviderEgressInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        #[\SensitiveParameter]
        string|SecretHandle $apiKey,
        private readonly string $model = 'text-embedding-3-small',
        private readonly string $endpoint = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings',
        mixed $transport = null,                     // credential-free seam
        private readonly int $dimensions = 1536,
        mixed $authenticatedTransport = null,        // seam below credential injection
    );
}
```

**File:** `packages/ai-vector/src/OllamaEmbeddingProvider.php`

```php
final class OllamaEmbeddingProvider implements EmbeddingInterface, EmbeddingProviderEgressInterface
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/embeddings',
        private readonly string $model = 'nomic-embed-text',
        private readonly mixed $transport = null,    // callable for testing
        private readonly int $dimensions = 768,
    );
}
```

Ollama's `$transport` keeps the `(string $url, array $headers, array $body): array` shape. OpenAI's `$transport` is credential-free — `(string $url, array $payload): array`, invoked before any credential is resolved; the separate `$authenticatedTransport` seam receives headers below credential injection. A string `$apiKey` is wrapped into a legacy static `SecretHandle`; requests resolve it inside the registered `OpenAiEmbeddingCredentialOperation` consumer (purpose `waaseyaa.ai.embedding.v1`). When the seams are null, real HTTP calls are made.

`EmbeddingProviderEgressInterface::transmitsOffHost()` supplies the indexing
policy's terminal-provider classification. OpenAI always reports external.
Ollama reports local only for literal `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1`
endpoints. A provider that does not implement the interface is treated as
external.

`EmbeddingProviderFactory::fromConfig()` still returns `null` when `ai.embedding_provider` is unset or unknown (the warmer reports `skipped_no_provider`), but a configured `openai` provider is fail-closed: a raw `ai.openai_api_key` value, a missing kernel `SecretResolverRegistry`, or a missing/invalid typed `ai.openai_credential_reference` throws `ProviderCredentialConfigurationException` — there is no environment-variable fallback.

### Embedding execution and reconciliation (FW-AIV-EXECUTION-01)

HTTP saves, served revision pointer moves and reverts index synchronously after
true commit. Other kernels invalidate only. Lifecycle indexing and CLI
warm/refresh use one `EmbeddingExecutor` freshness protocol and fresh repository
reads, never an event snapshot or a preloaded entity chunk.

A served-source mutation emits `EntitySourceChangedEvent` after its writes and
inside its database transaction. The ai-vector subscriber advances the exact
identity's generation and invalidates potentially indexed vectors in that same transaction.
Publication obtains the generation lock, checks the operation token, rereads the
served projection without acquiring entity mutation locks, and replaces the
vector before releasing that lock. A concurrent source change must advance the
same generation before it can commit. Provider calls run outside source and
publication transactions. This closes the final-reread/publication race on both
supported backends; atomic vector replacement alone would not close it.
Generation tombstones survive deletion. Production invalidation is subscribed
only to the transactional source event, including HTTP mutations. There is no
post-delete or non-HTTP post-commit invalidation subscription: a delayed callback
must not advance a generation and delete a newer vector. HTTP post-commit indexing
is registered only with a configured provider. Superseded completion and failure
cleanup cannot overwrite or remove a newer vector. Only confirmed stores count
as stored; a superseded operation is not a successful store.

The built-in database guard requires source, generation and vector storage on
the same database connection. Missing generation schema refuses activation or
source mutation/execution. Custom storage requires a compatible explicitly bound guard qualified
for atomic source invalidation and publication, and a repository that supplies
fresh served reads. Cached custom repositories must participate in that protocol.
`EmbeddingStorageInterface` remains the sole storage contract. The retained
`invalidateOnly` mode refuses `[AIV-EXECUTION-008]` without mutation; applications
migrate to transactional source events. Standalone `EntityEmbeddingCleanupListener`
requires a fresh manager, locks the generation and verifies source absence before
removing a vector. Missing manager refuses without mutation.

The built-in guard's monotonic `potentially_indexed` marker allows only
policy-undeclared, proven never-indexed identities to skip projection deletion
while retaining source-token advancement. Provider intent and canonical direct
stores promote history before indexing; pure excluded cleanup does not. Existing
generations are conservatively historical after migration and legacy vectors
are backfilled. Previously indexed or uncertain identities retain fail-closed
invalidation and rollback; missing/corrupt authority refuses. This does not
tolerate entity-database failure or add deferred deletion. Artifact installation
must reconcile imported vectors with serving history without accepting artifact
tokens. Quiesce old writers before migrating/activating this protocol. See
FW-AIV-UNINDEXED-AVAILABILITY-01 and the semantic search contract for the complete
availability, compatibility and operator obligations. Public storage/guard
interface signatures and network budgets are unchanged.

| Operation | Built-in network-transfer budget |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP lifecycle `embedForSave()` | 2 seconds |
| CLI warm/refresh and semantic query, Ollama `embed()` | 15 seconds |
| CLI warm/refresh and semantic query, OpenAI `embed()` | 20 seconds |

Each transfer has one attempt, no retries or redirect following, verified TLS,
and a 1 MiB response cap. Symfony's total `max_duration` bounds connection and
body, alongside its inactivity timeout. These are network bounds, not a whole
HTTP request, credential-resolution, database, or multi-entity batch deadline.
The longer operator/query budgets preserve legitimate workloads exceeding the
save-time budget. Timeout, HTTP refusal and malformed response fail explicitly.
Post-commit provider failures are logged; operator failures propagate. Source
invalidation failures abort the source transaction. Operators monitor source
mutation errors and all post-commit indexing failures separately.
`AIV-EXECUTION-007` additionally identifies unconfirmed guarded cleanup. Cleanup
is conditional on the current token and is never reported successful if it fails.

HTTP custom providers must implement `EmbeddingSaveProviderInterface` and honor
its one-attempt two-second network obligation. Missing capability refuses
save-time embedding and invalidates. Arbitrary PHP providers or callable
transport overrides cannot be preempted; their owners must qualify the budget.

`waaseyaa/http-client` owns the maintained Symfony HTTP implementation.
ai-vector's minimal `EmbeddingHttpTransport` retains payload, status and JSON
validation, while providers retain credential and endpoint policy. The split
http-client package requires Symfony HttpClient ^7.4 and contracts ^3.0; the
candidate lock uses HttpClient 7.4.20. Symfony's native fallback supports hosts
without ext-curl. Existing StreamHttpClient and ai-agent transport consolidation
remain with their package maintainers, outside this slice.

There is no embedding queue producer, retry worker or automatic repair loop.
The unsupported listener `queue` argument, `ai_vector.embed_entity` dispatch and
queue dependency are removed. Application owners remove historical orphan
messages rather than replay them. The application operator owns reconciliation:
schedule a full `semantic:refresh` sweep at the application's declared freshness
SLA, monitor listener errors, nonzero command exits and eligible-content search
coverage, and rerun the sweep after provider/storage recovery. Committed source
changes invalidate immediately; coverage can remain absent until a successful
HTTP indexing attempt or scheduled/manual refresh. No immediate coverage promise
is made for imports, CLI saves, worker mutations or failed provider calls.

Policy configuration is immutable for a booted process. Deployments changing
projection or exclusion must quiesce old workers, apply migrations, purge
excluded vectors, restart with the new policy and run a full refresh before
claiming reconciled coverage. The generation guard is a content freshness fence,
not a durable cross-process policy-version authority. The default-deny policy,
explicit label/egress permission and AIV-POLICY-001 refusal remain unchanged.

### Canonical embedding storage and semantic search

`EmbeddingStorageInterface` is the only supported storage contract. Its
`store(type, string id, vector)`, `findSimilar(query, type, limit)` and
`delete(type, id)` operations are specified in
[semantic-search-contract.md](semantic-search-contract.md), together with the
HTTP JSON:API and MCP wire contracts and their shipped schemas.

The former `VectorStoreInterface`/DTO family is removed under alpha DIR-003;
it promised language variants and metadata the runtime never supported.
UPGRADING.md contains the migration recipe. No compatibility adapter silently
discards those promises. Save and refresh retain one `EmbeddingIndexPolicy`.

### Lifecycle composition and entry-point contract (FW-AIV-COMP-01)

The package is opt-in at two boundaries (FW-AIV-DIST-01):

- `waaseyaa/framework`, `waaseyaa/cli`, and `waaseyaa/full` do not require it
  at runtime. CLI and full only suggest it.
- Installing it is not activation. `ai.vector_enabled` must be exactly `true`.
  Otherwise its provider binds nothing, registers no secret consumer or
  lifecycle listener, and its semantic CLI provider yields no commands.

The only supported `ai.vector_backend` value is `database`. It means portable
JSON-vector storage through the application's `DatabaseInterface`; it does not
mean a native vector extension. `pgvector` and unknown values refuse provider
registration with `[AIV-BACKEND-001]`. Sovereignty defaults advertise
`database` for every profile until another backend has an implementation and a
qualification run.

### Embedding index and egress policy

`ai.vector_index` is the only indexing allowlist. A missing policy or an
undeclared entity type is not embedded. Each entry contains a non-empty
`fields` list and an optional `allow_external` boolean, which defaults to
`false`:

```php
'vector_index' => [
    'node' => [
        'fields' => ['label', 'title', 'body', 'description'],
        'allow_external' => false,
    ],
],
```

`label` is a reserved projection name for `EntityInterface::label()`. Every
other name is read through `EntityValues::toCastAwareMap()`. There is no
implicit label, entity ID, or fallback source. An empty projection is denied.
Nodes additionally retain the served-public `WorkflowVisibility` gate.

`EmbeddingIndexPolicy` is composed once by `AiVectorServiceProvider` and is
shared by the lifecycle listener and `SemanticIndexWarmer`. A denied entity is
never passed to the provider and its existing vector is deleted. After a type
is removed from policy, `semantic:refresh --type=<entity-type>` is the explicit
reconciliation path for its stored vectors. Invalid policy shapes fail provider
registration with `[AIV-POLICY-001]`.

`AiVectorServiceProvider` is the only composition owner. Every consumer
resolves `EmbeddingStorageInterface` and `EmbeddingProviderInterface` through
the kernel services, where the first provider to bind an interface wins:

- the lifecycle listeners;
- `SearchRouter`, through `HttpKernel::semanticSearchServices()`;
- `SemanticIndexWarmer`;
- any host that resolves them from the kernel services bus, such as a
  host-wired `vector.search`.

The rule applies to each interface separately after explicit activation.
`AiVectorServiceProvider` binds the storage when enabled, but binds the embedding provider only when
`ai.embedding_provider` is configured. So:

- A provider that loads earlier and binds an interface is used for it by
  every consumer.
- A provider that loads later and binds the storage, or the embedding
  provider while ai-vector has one configured, is used by no consumer.
- A provider that loads later and binds the embedding provider while
  ai-vector has none configured makes the only binding, so every consumer
  uses it. HTTP saves then embed with it.

The storage and the embedding provider can therefore come from different
providers, but every consumer gets the same pair. No kernel or router
constructs its own storage or provider.

| Entry point | On save or revision pointer move | On delete |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP, provider configured | Embeds served, indexable content; removes the vector otherwise (re-sourced from the served row). | Removes the vector. |
| HTTP without a provider, and every other kernel (CLI, imports, queue workers) | Removes any existing vector, including for indexable content. Never calls the embedding provider. | Removes the vector. |

Outside HTTP, `semantic:refresh` re-indexes. Until it runs, an entity saved
there isn't found by semantic search. It never has a stale vector.

`boot()` registers the cleanup listener and an `invalidateOnly`
`EntityEmbeddingListener` in every kernel. When a provider is bound,
`configureHttpKernel()` swaps the save listener for the embedding one.
Registration is idempotent across re-entered boots.

**Post-commit failures are best-effort.** POST_SAVE and POST_DELETE run after
the mutation has committed. Every storage call and every re-sourcing read in
both listeners catches `\Throwable`, logs one error through the kernel
logger, and returns. So the committed mutation is reported as successful and
later listeners still run.

**Tests:**
- `EmbeddingCompositionTest`: instance identity per entry point, single registration, and provider order (a host binding registered before ai-vector reaches every consumer; one registered after reaches none while ai-vector binds both interfaces, and its embedding provider reaches every consumer when ai-vector has none configured);
- `ConsoleVectorInvalidationTest`: a console-kernel save of indexable content and a delete each remove the vector, with a provider configured;
- `PostCommitVectorFailureTest`: through a real repository with a failing storage.

**`SemanticIndexWarmer`:** uses the same composed `EmbeddingIndexPolicy` as
the lifecycle listener, including node visibility, field projection, egress,
and deletion of denied entities.



**Vector search guards:** `SearchController` uses **`EntityValues::toCastAwareMap`** + **`statusToInt`** when filtering relationship/public context — do not switch those paths to raw `toArray()`.

Canonical rules: `docs/specs/entity-system.md` (Casting & hydration architecture).

### DatabaseEmbeddingStorage and the `embeddings` table

**Files:** `packages/ai-vector/src/DatabaseEmbeddingStorage.php`,
`packages/ai-vector/migrations/2026_09_24_000001_embeddings_schema.php`.
Change record: `docs/change-records/FW-AIV-PERSIST-01.md` (#3138).

`EmbeddingStorageInterface`'s production implementation stores one vector per
`(entity_type, entity_id)` in the `embeddings` table on the application's main
database.

- **Schema ownership:** the table belongs to ai-vector's package migration,
  run through the schema coordinator like every other package migration.
  Nothing on the save, delete or search path creates schema.
- **Database access:** only through `DatabaseInterface`. There is no raw
  `\PDO`, and the storage never changes the connection's attributes.
- **Writes:** `store()` deletes and inserts in one transaction.
- **Migration not yet applied:** every operation refuses with
  `[AIV-STORAGE-001]` after logging a warning; no schema is created.
- **Invalid stored vectors:** search refuses with `[AIV-STORAGE-002]`.
- **Refresh:** both operator paths count confirmed writes/deletes and propagate
  failures. Missing hydration and failed reindexing invalidate old vectors.
- **Backends:** `database` is qualified on SQLite and PostgreSQL. Native vector
  backends are unsupported and refused explicitly.

The migration handles an existing table as follows:

| Live state | Result |
| --- | --- |
| No table | Creates it: `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `vector` (text affinity), `updated_at` (integer affinity), all NOT NULL, primary key `(entity_type, entity_id)`. |
| Exactly that shape | Adopted in place with every row. The pre-migration runtime code created this shape. |
| Any other shape | Refused with `[AIV-DB001]`, naming each difference. The transition rolls back. |

It never drops, recreates, renames or empties the table. Embeddings are a
rebuildable projection (`semantic:refresh`).

#### Adopting a runtime-created embeddings table

Before the migration existed, the storage created `embeddings` at runtime. If
that happened after the schema manifest was recorded, `migrate --verify`
reports `schema_drift` and every coordinated transition, including this
migration, refuses with `[S1-DB109]`. For the case where `embeddings` is the
only drift, use the S1 spec's governed re-adoption with these proofs. General
adoption tooling belongs to #3110.

1. Back up the database (for SQLite: `.backup`, then check the backup's
   integrity).
2. Prove `embeddings` is the only drift. On a scratch copy (for example
   `VACUUM INTO`), drop `embeddings` and run `migrate --verify` against the
   copy. In its `[authority:…]` line, the recorded and live values of both
   `schema=` and `ledger=` must be equal. The kind must be `match`, or
   `source_catalog_mismatch` when the release you're running brings pending
   migrations such as this one; in that case `STATUS` still reads FAIL, which
   is expected. Any other kind, or any unequal `schema=` or `ledger=` pair,
   means something else drifted too: stop and don't re-adopt.
3. Prove the table has the expected shape. For SQLite, run
   `PRAGMA table_info(embeddings)`; it must show exactly the four NOT NULL
   columns above with key positions 1 and 2 on `entity_type` and `entity_id`.
   If it doesn't, stop. The migration would refuse with `[AIV-DB001]` anyway.
4. Record the row count, then apply the governed re-adoption from
   `docs/specs/s1-schema-authority.md` ("Governed re-adoption"), which clears
   the recorded fingerprints.
5. Run `migrate`. The ai-vector migration adopts the table in place and the
   transition records a fresh manifest. Confirm `migrate --verify` reports
   `STATUS: OK` and the row count is unchanged.

`packages/ai-vector/tests/Integration/EmbeddingsSchemaMigrationTest.php` runs
this procedure on a drifted SQLite database, along with create, in-place
adoption and every refusal case.

### DistanceMetric

**File:** `packages/ai-vector/src/DistanceMetric.php`

```php
enum DistanceMetric: string
{
    case COSINE = 'cosine';
    case EUCLIDEAN = 'euclidean';
    case DOT_PRODUCT = 'dot_product';
}
```

### FakeEmbeddingProvider (Testing)

**File:** `packages/ai-vector/testing/FakeEmbeddingProvider.php`

Deterministic embedding provider for tests, loaded only through
`autoload-dev`. Generates vectors by SHA-256 hashing the input text with HMAC
iterations, then normalizing to unit magnitude. Same text always produces the
same vector. Default dimensionality is 128.

## Semantic Warming + Baselines

### SemanticIndexWarmer

**File:** `packages/ai-vector/src/SemanticIndexWarmer.php`

Reusable warmer that iterates entity IDs in deterministic order, applies published-only workflow visibility for nodes, and updates/removes embeddings via `EntityEmbeddingListener`.

Contract:

- `contract_version: v1.0`
- `contract_surface: semantic_index_warm`
- stable report payload with:
  - requested entity types
  - processed/stored/removed/missing totals
  - per-type status blocks (`ok` / `missing_entity_type` / `skipped_no_provider`)
  - measured duration

Operational behavior:

- If no embedding provider is configured, declared types return `status=skipped_no_provider`; undeclared types can still be refreshed to delete vectors left by an earlier policy.
- Only entity types declared by `ai.vector_index` are indexed. For `node`, only `published` content is indexed; non-public states are removed from the semantic index.
- Candidate IDs are processed in deterministic chunks (`200` IDs per storage load) to stabilize memory and I/O under larger warming sets.

### Semantic Refresh Batch Contract

`SemanticIndexWarmer::warmBatch()` exposes resumable semantic refresh batches for operational pipelines and long-running index rebuilds.

Contract:

- `contract_version: v1.0`
- `contract_surface: semantic_index_refresh_batch`
- stable report payload with:
  - requested entity types
  - `batch_size` and `batch_processed`
  - stored/removed/missing totals for the executed batch
  - per-type status blocks (`ok` / `missing_entity_type` / `skipped_no_provider`)
  - `next_cursor` (`{type_index, offset}`) when work remains, or `null` when complete
  - measured duration

Operational behavior:

- Cursor input is optional and clamped to non-negative values.
- Batch execution is deterministic over sorted entity IDs and entity-type order.
- If no embedding provider is configured, declared types are skipped; undeclared types remain eligible for deletion-only refresh so a removed policy entry can be purged after provider removal.

### CLI Warm Command

**File:** `packages/cli/src/Command/SemanticWarmCommand.php`

`semantic:warm` is the framework-level operational entry point for deterministic warming runs.

Supported options:

- `--type|-t` one or more entity type IDs (repeatable / comma-separated)
- `--limit|-l` per-type candidate limit (0 = unbounded)
- `--json` full machine-readable report output

Exit semantics:

- `0` when warming completed (including partial skips for missing entity types)
- non-zero when no embedding provider is configured (`skipped_no_provider`)

### CLI Refresh Command

**File:** `packages/cli/src/Command/SemanticRefreshCommand.php`

`semantic:refresh` is the framework-level operational entry point for resumable batch refresh runs.

Supported options:

- `--type|-t` one or more entity type IDs (repeatable / comma-separated)
- `--batch-size|-b` max entities per batch execution
- `--cursor` JSON cursor (`{"type_index":0,"offset":200}`)
- `--until-complete` loop batches until `next_cursor=null`
- `--json` machine-readable report output (`runs`, `final`, `reports`)

Exit semantics:

- `0` when refresh execution completes
- non-zero when no embedding provider is configured (`skipped_no_provider`)

### Read-Path Baseline Drift Gate

**File:** `tests/Integration/Phase15/SemanticWarmBaselineIntegrationTest.php`

Deterministic baseline gate for semantic/discovery read paths:

- warms `node` embeddings using workflow fixture corpus,
- validates semantic/discovery/MCP/SSR-navigation output shape against a versioned baseline artifact:
  - `tests/Baselines/performance_regression_v1.1.json`
- enforces latency budgets for:
  - semantic warm
  - semantic search
  - SSR relationship-navigation browse path
  - discovery topic-hub path
  - MCP `ai_discover`
- supports controlled baseline refresh for local/CI maintenance via:
  - `WAASEYAA_UPDATE_PERF_BASELINE=1`

This gate is part of the v1.0 hardening verification substrate and is intended to detect both contract drift and severe read-path performance regressions.

### Visibility Invariant

AI search/indexing surfaces use `Waaseyaa\Workflows\WorkflowVisibility` as the canonical served-visibility primitive. They follow the materialized published-pointer `status` projection, not a working-copy state id, avoiding de-indexing still-live content during a forward draft.

## Tool Safety

MCP tool execution has the following safety properties:

1. **Exception isolation:** `AgentExecutor` wraps all execution paths in try/catch. Exceptions never propagate to the caller; they are converted to failure results and logged.
2. **Audit trail:** Every agent execution, dry-run, and tool call is recorded in `AgentAuditLog` with the agent ID, account ID, action type, success status, message, and timestamp. Tool arguments are redacted for the audit row via `AbstractAgentTool::argumentsForAudit()`, which recurses over arbitrarily-keyed payloads — list-valued arguments (integer keys, e.g. an `entity.create` `values.blocks`/`tags`) are preserved without error and never matched against credential names. The redaction runs on raw model-controlled input at the audit step, outside the `execute()` try/catch, so it must never raise (#1637).
3. **User context:** Agents always execute as a specific `AccountInterface`. The account ID is logged in every audit entry.
4. **Dry-run support:** All agents must implement `dryRun()` to preview changes without mutations.
5. **FieldableInterface check:** Updates verify the entity implements `FieldableInterface` before calling `set()`.
6. **Per-entity access on the stock entity tools (mandatory, fail-closed — C-12):** The stock `ai-tools` entity tools enforce the framework's per-entity `AccessPolicy` (the same `view`/`update`/`delete`/`create` gate the REST/GraphQL surfaces use), not just the coarse `tool.entity.*` capability. `AiToolsServiceProvider` injects the kernel `EntityAccessHandler` into the `AttributeToolRegistry`, which stamps every tool it hydrates so the gate is **always** active in production — it is not opt-in. Enforcement is **fail-closed**: if the handler is ever unavailable in a context that requires enforcement, the per-entity guards **deny** (single reads/writes return a `forbidden` error; `entity.list`/`entity.search` drop every candidate) rather than silently allowing — a wiring gap can never degrade to allow-all. The only place the guards no-op (allow) is bare/unit construction that never wires a handler and never stamps enforcement (capability-only mode), preserving the historical contract for hosts with no entity-access policy.

7. **Declared-schema enforcement on the MCP transport (#2145):** a tool's `inputSchema` is a *contract*, not documentation. `Waaseyaa\AI\Tools\Schema\ToolInputSchemaValidator` validates arguments against it before `execute()` runs, so a handler never sees input violating the shape it advertised through `tools/list`. See below.

8. **Asset reads are gated by the catalog row they wrote (#2517):** `AssetStoreInterface` takes the acting principal on both `upload()` and `get()`, and implementations MUST use it. `MediaAssetStore::get()` resolves the `media` row its `upload()` created and refuses unless the principal may `view` it; a retracted row, or bytes with no row, are indistinguishable from an asset that never existed. Re-uploading the same bytes writes another catalog row (content-addressed file, row accretion); `get()` returns the first matching row the principal may `view`, so an unpublished duplicate does not hide a later published one. Accepting a principal and ignoring it — as `get()` previously did — is not conformant: it makes every call site read as though a decision were being made. The writer on this boundary can be a remote agent, not only a human operator placing deliberately public assets, which is why this is a gate rather than a convention. The stored `source_uri` is scheme-qualified (`public://…`) so the row is servable by the media package's authorized download route; see `docs/specs/content-publishing.md` for the tool-level contract and the retraction semantics.

## Declared input-schema validation (`ToolInputSchemaValidator`, #2145)

`Waaseyaa\AI\Tools\Schema\ToolInputSchemaValidator` is a dependency-free
validator for the JSON Schema draft 2020-12 subset the first-party tool
catalogue actually declares. It lives in `ai-tools` because that package owns
the `AgentTool::$inputSchema` contract, which keeps it importable by any
same-or-higher-layer executor without an upward dependency.

```php
/** @return list<array{field: string, message: string}> Empty when valid. */
ToolInputSchemaValidator::validate(array $schema, mixed $value): array
```

The `{field, message}` result shape deliberately matches
`ContentPublishingException::$fieldErrors`, so a transport renders schema and
domain validation failures identically. Nested paths are dotted
(`values.title`), array items indexed (`tags.1`), and a root-level mismatch
reports `(arguments)`.

**Supported keywords:** `type` (single or list), `properties`, `required`,
`additionalProperties` (`false` or a subschema), `enum`, `const`, `items`,
`min`/`maxItems`, `uniqueItems`, `min`/`maxLength`, `pattern`, `minimum`,
`maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`, and the in-place applicators
`allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf` (#2737). Unrecognised keywords (`default`,
`description`, `format`, `$schema`, `x-*`) are **ignored** — a schema is never
rejected for vocabulary the validator does not police. That list is the
complete enforced vocabulary — a documented subset, not full draft 2020-12
conformance; `$ref` is not implemented.

**Applicator semantics:** `allOf` applies every subschema and reports their
violations as-is. `anyOf` passes when at least one alternative accepts the
value. `oneOf` passes when exactly one alternative accepts the value; matching
more than one is a violation (`Matches 2 of the 2 allowed alternatives; exactly
one is required.`). When no alternative accepts the value and exactly one
alternative fits the value's *type* — `anyOf [{string, maxLength}, {null}]`
given an over-long string, or the reference-list item `oneOf [{integer,
minimum: 1}, {string, minLength: 1}]` given `0` — that alternative's own
violations are reported at their real path (`values.related.0`), so an agent
sees the concrete constraint rather than a generic union failure; otherwise a
single `Does not match any of the N allowed alternatives.` lands on the field.
`uniqueItems` compares decoded-JSON items with strict equality like
`enum`/`const` (`1` ≠ `"1"`, `1` ≠ `1.0`) and reports the later duplicate's
index. Applicators run after the value's own keywords, so a `type` mismatch
beside `anyOf` still yields one violation. The same validator guards
`outputSchema` on the way back (`AgentToolDispatcher`), so `ContentToolSet`'s
`id: oneOf [integer, string]` is now enforced there too — `ContentPublisher`
returns the persisted entity's `int|string` id, which satisfies it.

**Value model:** arguments arrive as `json_decode($body, true)` produces them,
so a JSON object is an associative array and the empty array satisfies both
`object` and `array`. `integer` accepts integral floats (JSON has one number
type, so `2.0` is a valid integer), and booleans never satisfy `string` or
`number`. An empty schema validates nothing.

**Where it is enforced:** the MCP bridge (`docs/specs/mcp-endpoint.md`,
"Input-schema enforcement (`tools/call`)"), which covers both the public
`/mcp` and authenticated `/mcp/write` tiers. The in-app `AgentExecutor` path
is unchanged and still relies on each tool's own argument-shape checks —
extending enforcement there is a separate decision, not an implied one.

## Identity-Key Write Protection (stock entity tools, #1646)

Applies to the stock tools `entity.create` and `entity.update` (`packages/ai-tools/src/Entity/`, see `docs/specs/agent-executor.md` for the tool registry), over every transport that dispatches them (in-app agent, MCP). Guard implementation: `Waaseyaa\AI\Tools\Entity\EntityKeyGuard`. Canonical contract: `kitty-specs/live-entity-validation-key-protection-01KTWQT3/contracts/tool-refusal.md`.

### Refusal set

Per entity type: the registered entity-key column names for the kinds `id`, `uuid`, `revision`, `langcode`, `default_langcode` (so renamed columns like `id => nid` are refused under their real name), unioned with the literal names `uuid`, `langcode`, `default_langcode`, `revision_id`, `published_revision_id` (the floor catches translatable schema columns on types that never registered the kind, and — the `revision_id`/`published_revision_id` pair, added CW-v1 option-1 PR-4 — the revision-pointer/bookkeeping columns `docs/specs/content-workflow.md` and `docs/specs/api-layer.md` "Write-side field allowlist" name directly: `published_revision_id` carries no entity-key kind on any shipped entity type, so only the literal floor closes it; before this addition it was silently `set()`-able through `entity.update`/`entity.create` despite the "identity fields cannot be written through this tool" contract). The `label` and `bundle` kinds are NEVER refused — label is ordinary content (e.g. `title`), bundle is create-time structure.

### Whole-write rejection

If the `values` payload contains ANY refused key, the tool returns an error result: no entity is constructed (create) and no field is set (update). Partial application is forbidden. On create this includes a model-supplied `id` — agent-created entities get system-assigned identity (research D3); the `enforceIsNew()` pre-set-id path remains available to non-tool callers, and consumers needing agent-driven pre-set ids ship a custom tool.

### Check order

capability → argument shape → entity-type existence → access → **identity-key refusal** → **per-field edit access (#1638)** → mutation/validation. The refusal must not leak entity existence to callers lacking access; the per-field edit gate (see *Per-field edit access* below) likewise runs after the entity-level `access` check, before any `set()`. The `access` step is the mandatory, fail-closed per-entity `AccessPolicy` gate (Tool Safety property 7, C-12): in production it is always wired and authoritative; it denies (never silently passes) when the access handler is unavailable, so a wiring gap cannot let identity-key probing or mutation proceed.

### Error shapes

Identity-key refusal (keys sorted alphabetically):

```
message: "entity.<op>: refused identity keys: <k1>, <k2> — identity fields cannot be written through this tool"
content: [ {"type": "text", "text": <message>},
           {"type": "json", "data": {"error": "identity_keys_refused", "refused_keys": ["<k1>", "<k2>"]}} ]
```

Save-time validation failure (`EntityValidationException` is caught distinctly, before the generic `\Throwable` arm; violations sorted by field name, insertion order as the stable tiebreak — NFR-003 determinism):

```
message: "entity.<op>: validation failed: <field>: <message>[; <field>: <message>...]"
content: [ {"type": "text", "text": <message>},
           {"type": "json", "data": {"error": "validation_failed",
             "violations": [ {"field": "...", "message": "...", "invalid_value_type": "..."} ]}} ]
```

Other throwables keep the generic error mapping. The tools add no private validation fork and no `validate: false` — tool writes reach `EntityRepository::save()` with default validation ON (single seam; see `docs/specs/entity-system.md` § Entity Validation).

### Dry-run and revision_log

- **dry-run** reports an identity-key refusal identically to execute — a dry run of an invalid call must not claim it would succeed.
- **`revision_log` stays writable** via its dedicated tool argument; it is content, not identity.

### Per-field edit access (#1638)

Beyond the identity-key floor, the stock write tools enforce the framework's **per-field** `FieldAccessPolicy` for the `edit` operation on every submitted field — the same gate the REST (`JsonApiController::store()`/`update()`) and GraphQL write paths apply. `AbstractAgentTool::requireFieldEditAccess()` runs after the identity-key refusal and **before any `set()`**: if a `FieldAccessPolicyInterface` returns `Forbidden` for any submitted field, the whole write is rejected with a `forbidden` error and nothing is mutated or saved. Semantics match the HTTP path — **open-by-default**: a field with no field-policy opinion (`Neutral`/`Allowed`) stays writable; only an explicit `Forbidden` denies. It is a no-op only in capability-only construction (no access handler wired), preserving the historical contract for hosts with no field policy.

This closes the asymmetry whereby an agent holding entity-level `update`/`create` access could set a field a `FieldAccessPolicy` forbids (e.g. a privileged `roles`/`status` field) that the REST/GraphQL surfaces already refuse. **Configurable** per-type write allowlists (declarative scoping of which fields a given agent may write, beyond what the policy layer already expresses) remain the broader future mechanism and are still out of scope here.

## Aggregate Mutation Preconditions on the Stock Entity Tools

DB-03 makes `entity.update` and `entity.delete` conditional by default. Both
schemas require a top-level opaque `mutation_token` returned by `entity.read`.
The token binds the storage authority, tenant, entity type, entity id, aggregate
version, and random authority tag; it is never accepted through `values`.
Missing or malformed tokens are refused before mutation. A token transplanted
from another aggregate, or a token made stale by a winning update/delete,
returns the two-block `mutation_conflict` error and the losing call leaves no
row, revision, or event. Conflict output deliberately omits the current token:
the caller must reload through its authorized read surface.

`entity.read` exposes `mutation_token` only when the caller has an update or
delete tool capability **and** the matching entity policy permits that
operation. Read-only/anonymous callers never receive write-authority metadata.
Successful updates return the fresh successor token for safe chaining. Dry-run
validates the same mandatory canonical token shape but never claims its
read-compare is authoritative.

### Legacy revision-head guard (`expected_revision_id`, #1647)

Mission `optimistic-locking-01KTXCHY`. Canonical contract:
`kitty-specs/optimistic-locking-01KTXCHY/contracts/conflict-surfaces.md`. The
tools translate the storage contract (`docs/specs/revision-system-unified.md`
§3b); they implement no conflict check of their own.

#### `entity.update` — the `expected_revision_id` argument

Optional **top-level** argument (JSON Schema `integer`, `minimum: 1`):

```json
"expected_revision_id": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1,
  "description": "Optional optimistic-locking expectation: the revision_id the caller read. The save is refused with a revision_conflict error if the entity's current revision differs. Revisionable entity types only." }
```

It is an argument, not a value: `revision_id` inside `values` stays refused by
`EntityKeyGuard` (kind `revision`, see Identity-Key Write Protection above) —
the expectation can never collide with a writable field. When present, the save
call becomes `$repository->save($entity, context:
SaveContext::default()->withExpectedRevisionId($n))`, guarded by `$repository
instanceof EntityRepository` (the only SaveContext-capable implementation —
`EntityRepositoryInterface` is deliberately not widened); a stated expectation
against any other repository implementation returns the
`revision_expectation_unsupported` error, never a silent plain save. Omitting
this legacy revision guard does **not** permit a blind write: the aggregate
`mutation_token` remains mandatory. Check order preserves information-flow
semantics: capability → argument shape → type known → load → entity access
`update` → key/field refusal → aggregate token validation → field set →
guarded save.

#### Legacy revision error shapes (two-block, Mission 1 house shape)

Conflict — `RevisionConflictException` caught specifically, before the generic
`\Throwable` arm. **Machine-correctable: re-read (or use `current` directly),
re-diff, retry with the new revision id.**

```
content: [ {"type": "text", "text": <message>},
           {"type": "json", "data": {"error": "revision_conflict",
             "entity_type": "<type>", "id": "<id>",
             "expected": 5, "current": 6}} ]
```

`current` is `null` when no readable head exists (entity vanished, or a
pre-backfill row with no revision pointer). Deterministic: the two revision
ids plus static identity (NFR-003).

Unsupported path — the storage `\LogicException` rejection matrix (and the
non-concrete-repository case) maps to the same two-block shape. **Distinct
from `revision_conflict` — agents must NOT retry these.**

```
content: [ {"type": "text", "text": <message>},
           {"type": "json", "data": {"error": "revision_expectation_unsupported",
             "entity_type": "<type>", "reason": "<message>"}} ]
```

#### Dry-run parity

A dry run carrying `expected_revision_id` loads the entity and compares the
head: a mismatch returns the **byte-identical** `revision_conflict` payload a
real call would produce (same `data` members, same values for the same world
state — one shared builder, so the bytes cannot fork); a match returns the
existing `would_update` success. Without `expected_revision_id`, dry-run does
not load a revision head, but it still requires and canonically parses the
aggregate token. The dry-run check is a read-compare — it cannot be
authoritative; only the real save's guarded claim is.

#### Success payload and read exposure (FR-008)

- `entity.update` success payloads now carry `revision_id` = the post-save
  head (read back from the saved entity), so a chaining agent can state its
  optional legacy expectation without a re-read, plus the fresh mandatory
  aggregate `mutation_token`.
- `entity.read` emits a top-level `revision_id` member (duck-typed
  `getRevisionId()`; **omitted** for non-revisionable types — absence means
  "no expectation formable").
- `entity.list` items carry the same optional member (entities are already
  loaded — zero added queries).
- `entity.list_revisions` is unchanged (already exposes per-revision ids).
- Conflict payloads are themselves reads: they carry the current head, so the
  legacy revision re-diff can skip a round-trip. Aggregate conflicts never
  disclose a current mutation token and always require an authorized reload.

### The canonical consumer pattern

The approve-time staleness recipe (agent drafts a change, a human approves it
later, the entity may have moved in between) is documented step-by-step in the
mission quickstart —
`kitty-specs/optimistic-locking-01KTXCHY/quickstart.md` §2 (SC-002): record
`revision_id` at draft time, state it via `expected_revision_id` at approve
time, treat `revision_conflict` as the feature (re-read, re-diff, re-approve)
— the competing writer's work is never silently reverted. End-to-end pin:
`tests/Integration/AgentRun/DualWriterConflictTest.php`.

## Dual-State Bug Pattern

The Pipeline class explicitly guards against the dual-state bug pattern documented in CLAUDE.md. When entity data can exist in two locations (typed properties and the `$values` array), mutations must update both or use one canonical source.

Pipeline uses `syncStepsToValues()` to maintain a single source of truth. Called after every mutation (`addStep()`, `removeStep()`, and in the constructor). The `toConfig()` method reads from the `$this->steps` array (the canonical source) and serializes step configs inline.

**Rule:** When working on Pipeline or similar config entities with typed properties, always call the sync method after mutations. Do not read from `$this->values['steps']` directly; use `$this->getSteps()`.

## Observability Wiring Status (ai-observability, R18)

The canonical run telemetry path uses the `AgentRun*` lifecycle events. Both
production producer factories resolve the kernel dispatcher under the served
Symfony-contracts FQCN, type-check it against the foundation dispatcher
contract, and inject it into `AgentExecutor` / `RunAgentHandler`. Provider
boundary tests pin that wiring.

| Listener | Provider | Events | Status after WP4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AgentRunTelemetryListener` | `AgentTelemetryServiceProvider` | `Waaseyaa\AI\Observability\Event\AgentRun{Started,IterationCompleted,ProviderCallCompleted,ToolCallObserved,Terminated}` | **Live end-to-end.** Production factories inject the real dispatcher into both producers. Best-effort internally (every handler try-catch wrapped). |

The legacy `LlmCallListener` / `ToolCallListener` chain and its three ai-agent
event classes were deleted in R18: repository-wide search proved that no
production code constructed those events, while the richer `AgentRun*` path
already represented the same execution boundaries. Historical trace storage
and the explicit `TraceRecorderInterface` API are retained; no migration drops
existing trace data.

## Implementation gotchas

### Configuration authority dependency

`McpServiceProvider` declares an exact `configuration.authority.v1` capability
requirement. Provider composition therefore fails before boot when no compatible
configuration authority is registered. MCP server definitions are always read
through the active authority bridge in composed applications; the null storage
fallback exists only for explicit `local`, `dev`, `development`, and `testing`
profiles. Production, staging, misspelled, and unknown profiles fail closed
rather than silently starting with an empty MCP server set.

This capability is a runtime composition contract, not a dependency on a source
forge or CI vendor. Providers exchange stable capability identifiers, versions,
and authority fingerprints entirely inside the installed application.

- **Tool-loop wiring and allowlisting are inseparable (R18 M2+M3, #1975):**
  `RunAgentHandler` resolves provider descriptors only for
  `AgentDefinition::$tools`; `AgentExecutor` receives the same trusted name
  list and checks membership again before global-registry lookup or execution.
  Never wire provider tools without this second fail-closed gate.
- **`RunAgentHandler` enforces `AgentDefinition::$requiresCapability`** (audit
  A7 F2 / R10 WP2, 2026-07-05): this field used to be plumbed end-to-end
  (attribute → manifest → registry → definition) but never checked before
  execution — an agent declaring `requiresCapability` ran for any caller
  regardless of permissions, reachable via both `ai:run` (CLI) and
  `POST /api/ai/agent/run` (API). Both entries dispatch a `RunAgent` message
  handled by the same `RunAgentHandler::__invoke()`, so the fix lives there,
  once, after the initiator account is resolved and before
  `AgentExecutor::executeRun()` is called: a missing capability now marks the
  run terminal `failed` (`error_code='missing_capability'`) with zero
  `AgentAuditLog` rows, instead of running. See
  `docs/specs/agent-executor.md` "Identity & permissions" for the full gate
  inventory.
- **`AnthropicProvider` cURL streaming**: `CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION` callbacks must not throw — wrap `json_decode(..., JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR)` in try-catch inside callbacks. Error handling in `httpPostStreaming` must match `httpPost` (parse error body, handle 429 with `RateLimitException`).
- **A streaming caller's own deadline cannot bound a stalled stream**: it runs inside the chunk callback, and a stalled stream delivers no chunk. Bound the transport instead (`ProviderTimeouts`, `streamTimeouts:`) — never rely on a wall-clock check inside `$onChunk` to release the worker.
- **A non-streaming provider still stalls**: `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` has no stream, but a peer that answers and then delivers only part of the promised body pins the worker just the same, with no callback anywhere to observe it. The connect bound only covers a peer that never finishes connecting — it does nothing for a body that stalls after a successful connection, which by default is still bounded only by the total. Pass `timeouts:` with a low-speed pair when that shape matters to the caller.
